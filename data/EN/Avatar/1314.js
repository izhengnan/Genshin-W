What price will you pay in return?\"</i> she asked, a smile playing on her lips.<br><i>\"Our Cornerstones.\"</i> the young lady replied.<br><i>\"And my life, too. I have no choice except that if I want to tear open a gash in Penacony.\"</i> A glimmer of light flickered within the bottomless pupils of the young man.<br><br>When their eyes met, various memories of the past flickered past, then settled on the image of her first encounter with these two.<br>She let out a soft sigh, placing a miniature model of Penacony on one end of the scale.<br><i>\"Each of us has our own beginnings and endings.\"</i><br>The topaz stone was placed on the other end of the scale.<br><i>\"This journey together may be long or short, but as long as we haven't reached the end, we must honor our contract.\"</i><br>The aventurine stone followed.<br><i>\"In this world, nothing is truly beyond value. Everything can be measured, leveraged, and traded...\"</i><br>In the end, the jade stone was placed on the scale, and the scales tipped completely and fell.<br><i>\"Now, let's trade them for the future of Penacony.\"</i>"
