Theoretically, any armament the man comprehends thoroughly can be \"projected as a counterfeit countless times.\" However, due to some entanglements of karma, the man's Projection magecraft only reaches absolute perfection when creating objects that qualify as \"swords.\"<br><br><i>\"Sounds like a merchant selling knockoffs? Well, that's about right.\"<br>\"It's hardly the most honorable approach, but it's perfectly tailored for dealing with those self-important types who fabricate rules just to stand above others and exert their authority.\"</i><br><br>According to ancient legend, Kanshou and Bakuya were master swordsmiths. A husband-and-wife duo who exhausted every conceivable method attempting to overcome a fundamental limitation: That craftsmen couldn't control the quality of their forged blades, leaving each creation to fate's whims.<br>From this point, the tale branches into numerous versions. One claims that Bakuya sacrificed herself to the furnace, becoming one with the molten metal, enabling Kanshou to forge blades of unprecedented perfection that would never be equaled.<br>In the more widely celebrated version, a tyrannical ruler, frustrated by the slow pace of sword forging, executed Kanshou after receiving the masterpiece blades. Then, Bakuya escaped to the countryside with their child. Years later, this grown child encountered a wandering swordsman, and together they plotted revenge against the tyrant, a confrontation where all three ultimately perished together.<br><br>Does the man's own destiny mirror these ancient tales? If similarities exist, what did he ultimately sacrifice? Himself, his companions, or perhaps some cherished ideal?<br>No one knows.<br>What people do know is that he offered himself as its foundation for the sword residing in his heart — His body serving as steel, his blood as flame.<br>Though he crafted thousands of blades throughout his journey, in the end, he stood empty-handed, possessing nothing at all.<br>Just like his {RUBY_B#Unlimited Blade Works}mindscape{RUBY_E#}.<br><br><i>\"But isn't this precisely what life is about?\"<br>\"No sword can remain in one person's possession forever.

Don't be absurd. I'm just an ordinary person without their overwhelming magical energy reserves.\"</i><br><br>However, contrary to his statements, the man never hesitates to engage in close combat when the situation demands it. Leveraging his practically infinite supply of \"Kanshou and Bakuya,\" he uses dazzlingly complex sword skills that leave opponents struggling to defend themselves.<br><br><i>\"If regular bullets could get the job done, I wouldn't bother going through all this trouble.\"<br>\"But if you really wanna learn this move? Spend some time in the kitchen. Start by getting good with a knife.\"<br>\"I'm not messing around. Cooking teaches you a lot if you actually think about it. Take meal prep, for instance. You want a great dish on the table fast? You gotta break down every step, figure out what can be done at the same time, and streamline the whole process. Once you get the hang of that mindset, you'll start applying it to everything in your life. It saves you a ton of time.\"<br>\"Same with cooking temps. Newbies always think stir-frying means tossing everything into the pan in order until it's all cooked through.\"<br>\"That works fine for stuff that can take the heat. But other ingredients? They've got their own ideal cooking time and temp, so they don't always get along.\"<br>\"So most of the time, you've gotta sort your ingredients, adjust the heat for each one, and pull them off the burner at just the right moment. Then, bring everything back together to finish the dish balanced, flavorful, and just right.\"</i><br><br>Once he starts talking about cooking, the guy shifts gears entirely. Gone is his usual short-and-sharp talk. Instead, he dives into these long, thoughtful monologues, full of hard-won insight. For a man who's spent his whole life on the battlefield, it seems like what defines him isn't justice or suffering, but something quieter. Something like the everyday warmth of a home-cooked meal.<br><br><i>\"Like I said before, if you could take out your enemies from a distance with a sniper shot, nobody would risk getting up close and personal. It's the same when it comes to fate.\"<br>\"I exist to prove one thing: somewhere out there, in a corner of the world, there are people who have no choice but to fight fate in brutal, hand-to-hand combat, every single day. Because if they don't, they die.\"<br>\"I fought for them once. But the world only changed because people kept going, kept fighting fate without pause.\"<br>\"As for me... I'm just a man with nothing left, who's still a long way from ever {RUBY_B#reaching utopia}beating fate{RUBY_E#}.\"</i><br><br>One thing's for sure: He's not turning away from his mission to save humanity.<br>Just like he never says no to cooking for his friends."
