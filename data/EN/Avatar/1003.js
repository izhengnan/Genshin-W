And then more, smaller ones, flickering and flashing ever so finely before a magnificent blaze tore open the night.<br><br>Her limbs drag her forward, leading her on to where the land meets the ocean. At the shoreline, the waters jostle against her like how the tide treats that stranded Express, alone and lost.<br><br>She walks in and sees the scenery outside beginning to change. The Express shows her a myriad of magnificent worlds. They are faraway, beyond her homeworld, yet also close enough to be a simple train ride.<br><br>She tries to repair the Express. It starts up only briefly, but it is enough to skid across the sky of her home. She immediately sees the path home. From that altitude, the journey is so short, and even the ocean of her homeworld appears so insignificant.<br><br>It asked her whether she'd like to travel together. She wonders what kind of journey that would be.<br><br><i>\"A journey to the beginning.\"<br>\"Let's go then.\"</i> Without hesitation, the girl replied, <i>\"Just as you brought me home, so would I take you home, too.\"</i>"

She remembers how the Crew arrived at Herta Space Station, how she met Trailblazer, and how they'd embarked on a new journey once more.<br><br>She remembers the specifications for every single component of the Express and how they're assembled.
