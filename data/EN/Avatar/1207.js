Therefore, many of us are more passionate about enjoying the fun in life — chasing the best moments in life with all our heart and soul.<br><br>Me? I am currently 246 years old.

He would never die, but his body would continuously weaken and wither eternally. He would carry the burden and sufferance of old age of perpetuity. This was all because he dared to dream about an unchanging flesh.<br><br>At the end of the story, the old man who told me the story expressed the sentiments above. Perhaps, to Outworlders, the Xianzhou ships are dreamboats of bliss that traverse the ocean of stars, where people will spend their everlasting lifespan in enjoyment of sublime happiness, never knowing the pains of separation, aging, and death. In my opinion, that was not the case.<br><br>Xianzhou natives are precisely experiencing an eternal deterioration. Sure, I am as energetic as I was when I was fifty years old. I can drive a starskiff through a valley no wider than two yards, I can dance continuously for hours, and I can sing... You may find this difficult to believe, but I can sing better than many of the performing artists in the Exalting Sanctum.<br><br>Unfortunately, I will not do any of those things again. I do not want to do any of them, as they bring me no enjoyment. Not many things do. Not anymore.<br><br>This is our deterioration. This is the deterioration of all Xianzhou natives."
