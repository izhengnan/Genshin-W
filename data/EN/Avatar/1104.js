Back when he was still a humble private, he'd sworn to serve as Belobog's strongest shield and pledged to live and die with his comrades. This hasn't changed when he became a captain. This isn't some fireside joke of the Silvermane Guards, because Qlipoth is testimony to this oath.<br><br>However, right at this time, he isn't where he should be — and this is at the request of the Supreme Guardian.<br><br>What exactly is the Supreme Guardian thinking?

He forces himself not to think about it. For now, he could only meet the expectations of the Supreme Guardian and all of Belobog with a smile — because this is what a loyal soldier must do.<br><br>The moment the captain finishes putting on the arm armor, a brilliant beam of light shoots out from the joints between the plates.
