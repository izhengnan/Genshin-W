            "Name": "Last West Wind of Amphoreus",
            "Desc": "Encapsulated in the Planar Sphere is a chapter named An Eternal Page from <i>As I've Written</i>. It has been imbued with the fragrance of flowers, the warmth of the west wind... and an open ending.",
            "Story": "There is no eternal tranquility in this world. Even the dawn held high by Kephale will fade. Eternity exists only within warm memories.<br>In this thin page of The Eternal Land slumbers all the memories of Amphoreus's thirty million cycles, where infinite yesterdays piled into infinite tomorrows.<br>It is a peaceful paradise, the end of the west wind, and a sprouting thread of memory yet to bud.<br>Under a rosy-hued sky with no more snowstorms, bitter cold, or sudden rain, silver shallow beaches are covered in flower petals.<br><br>Those who were swept away by the waves of history have found refuge in peaceful dwellings. In their long leisure, people began to create dances never-before-seen and write plays never-before-told. In the misty bathhouses, people speak of heroes, while stars, wars, and refugees seem like distant memories. They marvel at the hazy lives they once led: Today's chefs were yesterday's scholars, and those who were once strangers have now become companions.<br><br>Those once known as the Chrysos Heirs, their journey of loss finally comes to an end.<br>The Goldweaver's eyes once again treasure beauty, the Holy Maiden's hands no longer bear death's cold touch, the fleet-footed thief runs only for happiness, and the physician need not weep for patients anymore. The crown prince of Kremnos feels the warmth of home, just as the white-haired boy from Aedes Elysiae still remembers the scorching flames of war that consumed his homeland. Yet upon waking from this grand dream, his parents are measuring his height while gently patting his head.<br><br>Sometimes, they would pass through the corridor dividing day and night, where the dazzling cosmos seemed within arm's reach. The sages of the Grove would often linger here to observe, while red-haired children loved to imagine shooting stars as the Astral Express during a warp. During festivals, the singer of the ocean would sing tales of the Nameless' adventures to everyone. The female ruler known as the Imperator would always raise a glass of honey brew in blessing to the heroes while gazing at distant worlds...<br><br>The seeds of the future have yet to sprout, while fallen petals of the past have already blanketed into a warm sea of flowers.<br>In a fleeting moment while traversing the stars, the Nameless might feel those anticipating gazes. This page of eternity, carried by the wings of Trailblaze, may yet have the chance to turn to its next chapter.<br>As for what those old friends left unsaid, members of the Nameless already understand.<br><br><i>\"...and you shall carry our story forward, into tomorrow.\"</i>",

            "Desc": "At the story's end, the data of thirty million cycles transforms into a complete poem, and the years written by the Recorder will remain in the cosmic memory, never fading away.",
            "Story": "The poem named Amphoreus, where time acts as its pages, and chaos marks its beginning. The golden blood engraves the footprints of defiance, as the heroes of the Flame-Chase lead the way in the grand enterprise of genesis.<br><br><i>The chapter of \"Passage,\" enlightening messages of salvation, a thousand tomorrows rising in succession.<br>The chapter of \"Law,\" wagering against the gods, all for the world to stand among the stars.<br>The chapter of \"Ocean,\" though waves may break, resisting against the void for a thousand years.<br>The chapter of \"Romance,\" leading the Flame-Chase Journey, weaving the future with golden threads.<br>The chapter of \"Strife,\" a path of blood and fire, where scars write of solitary glory.<br>The chapter of \"Trickery,\" truth wrapped in lies, preserving light within the Evernight.<br>The chapter of \"Life and Death,\" embracing lost souls, keeping the cycle of life and death eternal.<br>The chapter of \"Reason,\" life cast into flames, as souls question the world's truth.<br>The chapter of \"Sky,\" healing hearts with faint light, mending dawn and dusk with human will.<br>The chapter of \"Worldbearing,\" rage burning away the cage, the hero bringing forth the light of Dawn.<br>The chapter of \"Earth,\" forging the blood of Permanence, sheltering the wandering creatures of the land.<br>The chapter of \"Time,\" watching over countless pasts, dedicating memories that shall not fade into oblivion.<br>...</i><br><br>Through thirty million cycles, a girl held her pen, nurturing the naive \"heart\" with memories, as thirteen hues finally merged into the color of \"love.\"<br>When shooting stars streaked across the sky, a hero from beyond the sky took up the pen, embarking once again with companions on the Flame-Chase Journey, writing an unprecedented ending through the way of the Trailblaze.<br>At the story's end, blossoms flourished in the eternal Pure Land.<br>On one end where night lingers, starlights twinkled. On the other end where day shines, people rubbed their eyes and awakened. As the west wind gently brushed past, people greeted each other good morning, just as they had done through thirty million cycles.<br>Here, the story draws its final period, like a blazing sun that's no longer blinding, like the Compass of the Trailblaze, and like an eye filled with love.<br><br><i>\"In this world, they fused burning golden ichor into their bodies.<br>Will destiny remember their names in the days to come?\"</i><br>Now, the poem's question has found its answer.<br>The memories that awaken at dawn will never forget. Amphoreus, that is its name.",
