        "Story": "◆ Currency Wars ◆<br>The Strategic Investment Department seems to have run into some trouble, but this could be your chance to get hands-on experience in the capital game. Why not seize this opportunity and go all in? Carve out your own path in the world of wealth.<br><br>◆ Gameplay Goal ◆<br>● In each round of Currency Wars, Trailblazers must face different enemies and bosses across 3 planes. As the battle progresses, gather resources, build your team, and increase your power to ultimately defeat the boss and achieve victory.<br>● Trailblazers start with initial squad HP. In combat across multiple nodes, you must defeat all enemies within the limited action value to win battles. If you fail to defeat all enemies within the specified action value, you will lose some HP. The match concludes when your squad HP drops to 0.<br><br>◆ New Character Gameplay Abilities ◆<br>● Characters joining \"Currency Wars\" will gain new gameplay-exclusive abilities including Positioning, Character Empowerment, Bond, Cost, and Star Rating.<br>● Characters have their own positioning, divided into on-field, off-field, and some characters can be both. Before combat begins, when characters are placed in their correct positions, they will activate their exclusive new ability, Character Empowerment, bringing different combat experiences.<br>● Characters possess their own unique Character Empowerment that either enhances their existing abilities or grants them new combat abilities.<br>● Each character has their own Bond. When a certain number of characters with the same Bond are deployed, the corresponding Bond effect will be activated, providing combat buffs. The more members sharing the same Bond, the higher the Bond level becomes, resulting in stronger Bond effects.<br>● Characters have different \"costs,\" which refer to the amount of gold coins required to purchase them. The cost can be: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Character combat powers receive an initial boost based on their cost. The higher the cost, the stronger the combat powers. Characters with the same cost have similar combat powers.<br>● Characters have a star rating, starting at 1 star. Recruiting 3 characters of the same star rating will automatically upgrade that character's star rating, greatly improving their combat powers. 3-star is typically a character's strongest form.<br><br>◆ Character Recruitment Rules ◆<br>● If the Trailblazer already owns a character from Currency Wars, their build data will be carried over.<br>● If a character in Currency Wars is not yet owned, then their trial version can be recruited.<br>● If an owned character (including Level, Traces, Relics, Eidolons), or Light Cone level does not meet the required standards, the system will automatically enhance them, and you will recruit a mapped version of the character and Light Cone. This enhancement is only effective in Currency Wars.<br>● Off-Field characters' Eidolons and exclusive Light Cones will be converted into abilities and stat effects exclusive to Currency Wars.<br><br>◆ Combat Rules ◆<br>● In Currency Wars combat, when a character receives a killing blow, they won't be knocked down. Instead, they'll immediately recover some HP, but the remaining combat countdown will be reduced, ending the battle earlier.<br>● In Currency Wars gameplay, Energy restored when ally characters defeat enemy targets is 50% of what it would be in regular combat.<br><br>◆ Standard Gambit ◆<br>● In Standard Gambit, players can choose the challenge difficulty that matches their current highest rank.<br>● After a Standard Gambit victory settlement, a battle rating will be obtained based on the remaining squad HP, which will promote the rank and unlock new challenge difficulties. As the match difficulty increases, the enemy difficulty will also increase, and enemy affixes will be acquired.<br>● After a Standard Gambit victory settlement, you can obtain Currency Wars points and Ascension Points. The higher the match difficulty, the more Ascension Points you will receive upon completion.<br>● In the Standard Gambit mode, reaching the corresponding rank will grant rewards of Stellar Jade and Ascension Points. Failing a match will not lower the current rank.<br><br>◆ Overclock Gambit ◆<br>● Overclock Gambit is a faster mode with less playtime investment and can be used to complete Currency Wars Point Rewards.<br>● In Overclock Gambit, you can freely choose the challenge difficulty, but it cannot exceed the highest rank achieved in Standard Gambit.<br>● After an Overclock Gambit victory settlement, you can obtain points, Ascension Points, and Equivalent Banknotes as rewards.<br>● Overclock Gambit does not affect the current rank.<br><br>◆ Gameplay Rewards ◆<br>● During Currency Wars settlement, you can earn Currency Wars Points based on your challenge progress and claim Point Rewards. These rewards refresh every two weeks on Monday at 04:00 (Server Time).<br>● Complete Currency Wars matches to earn Ascension Points and increase your Ascension level to receive Level Rewards.<br>● Clear matches with different Bond Lineups to earn Bond Challenge Rewards.<br>● Receive rank rewards when first promoted to corresponding ranks.<br>● Collect Currency Wars Investment Environment and Investment Strategy index to earn Collection Rewards.<br>● Earn additional Ascension Point rewards for your first clearance of Standard Gambit or Overclock Gambit every two weeks.<br>● Complete designated objectives in Startup Guide and Expected Profit to receive corresponding rewards.",

Upon completion of each Journey, some \"Legends Past and Present\" combat challenge will be unlocked.<br>● During the event, once Trailblazers complete a Hero's Journey, they will receive a Protagonist Model and gradually improve the abilities within it. These abilities can help to form a more riveting experience in Legends Past and Present.<br>● The Protagonist Model can provide various Plot Armor combinations that can be freely adjusted, and their effects will be active in Legends Past and Present.<br>● Good combinations of Plot Armor in the Protagonist Model will result in higher combat scores.<br>● Trailblazers can use trial characters in Legends Past and Present.<br>● During combat, enemies will continuously appear for a limited number of Cycles. Points will be awarded for dealing damage to and defeating enemies. At the end of each battle, the highest score will be updated based on the results of the current challenge.<br>● Raising the Equilibrium Level will also raise the enemy and trial character levels in the event.<br><br>◆ Event Rewards ◆<br>During the event, Trailblazers can claim challenge rewards from the Rewards Catalog after reaching certain scores in Legends Past and Present. When at least 10,000 points have been scored for each Legends Past and Present, a new section of the Readable <i>Legend of the Trailblazer</i> will be unlocked that corresponds to this particular Legend Past and Present. The main characters in the Readable will change depending on the characters used by the Trailblazer in combat. After unlocking all sections of the Readable, Trailblazers can obtain the limited item \"Legend of the Trailblazer,\" which can be viewed at any time from the Mission Item panel in your Inventory.

        "Story": "In 2104 AE, Fomenko — a Candelagraphos scribe — obtained a mute parrot. She took great care of it, but it still only lived for less than a decade. To commemorate her mute friend, Fomenko made quills out of the ten outermost feathers of the parrot's wings. One of these was for herself, while the other nine were stored in a vault.<br>She used this one quill to annotate for an entire Amber Era, preserving vast swathes of ancient documents on the verge of being lost. At her funeral, her peers and students burst into tears because \"a lamp that illuminated our cosmic past had been snuffed out.\"<br>It wasn't until people went over Fomenko's legacy that they finally realized that the scribe had been writing nothing but lies with her quills.<br><br><i>\"Since the beginning of human history, the birds have been observing all the glory, folly, and glorious and foolish things humans have accomplished. The birds know. The birds take part. The birds remain silent.\"</i>",
