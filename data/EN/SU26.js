The user can only think from their perspective for all eternity, and can never truly understand the other party's intention. There are even those who claim that the IPC already has a tight grasp on the beacon's master permissions and that all you and everyone else hear are words that have already been altered. Therefore, they manually created interference events and tried their best to destroy the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, with the sole aim of letting many languages on the brinks of death return to the Cosmos — \"The Synesthesia School says that the Synesthesia Beacon is The Riddlers' natural enemies, but The Riddlers claim that Synesthesia Beacons are doing an even better job at riddling.\"",

Pin the information on every particle on the board and still the wings, then bind the butterfly's path and make reality dance in the way you want it to. Any tiny change would instantly disintegrate the fragile balance. No matter how much the scholars continue to perfect the model, they could only consider the foolish act of unifying the pattern of movement as the hubris of mortals. Therefore, I still clearly remember the first day I killed the butterfly, even though it was so long ago. I remember how the point of the knife stabbed into its chest.",

The meddlesome Masked Fools gained inspiration from this misunderstanding and imitated the concept of the Gold Coins of Discord to create a credit tree, spreading the seeds far and wide. Fearing inevitable inflation, the IPC immediately set blockades across large borderland areas and rushed to the fruit fields to investigate.

They could simulate the physical form of native citizens and connect to the senses of their controller to allow the trailblazing journey to continue through even the harshest environments through long-distance operations. Due to their lack of realism, clay doll exploration was quickly abandoned by the Nameless, but this technology became a huge boom in the field of interstellar tourism, allowing the IPC to make massive profits.",

Their excessive energy and aggressiveness make Barzarton lizards demonstrate capacities far beyond that of ordinary vehicles. Some deceptive businesspeople even named the species \"Destructive Mega Lizard,\" hoping to sell it to newbie Annihilation Gang members for a high price on the black market.

That was how Talia's lizard breeding industry was born.",
