                "<br>In a bygone time which only the Jinn recall, the Lord of Flowers was cast aside by the heavens.<br>Her magnificent vessel was left a savaged husk, her kinsfolk punished by way of being stripped of their minds...<br><br>Legend has it that the Lord of Flowers wandered the barren wastes for seventy-two nights...<br>Her heels were worn through by the merciless gravel. Her wounds gushed into limpid springs, turning into streams with no boundaries.<br>Thence, those streams flowed into verdant gardens, from which sprouted night-blue water lilies.<br>Water lilies are the mothers of the Jinn, and the Jinn were birthed from intoxicating dreams and the bitter memories of loss.<br><br>The first Jinn were creatures of wisdom. They indulged in innocent dreams and love just as sweet.<br>To thank their creator, the infantile Jinn took their mistress by the arm and granted her a laurel wreath of wild chrysanthemums. <br><br>\"Oh, Lord of Flowers, master of the garden, we beg of thee — stay, leave us not!\"<br>\"Yes. Please, dream-mother, mistress of forgetting and wine, we beg of you — remain queen of this garden.\"<br><br>As so, detained by the gentleness of the Jinn, the exiled goddess remained in this garden of flowers.<br>Gorgeous purple flowers bearing semblance to the moon bloomed wherever she stopped by. They were named \"Padisarah.\"<br>"

Upon the tombstone of divinity shall humanity become the god of gods.\"<br>\"Such a carefree dream was certain to be unmade. In ruins where lies are sundered, humanity will become the king of kings.\"<br><br>The Lord of Flowers capitulated to her friend's folly, finding a most admirable rebellion burning within the ambitions of the god.<br>An idea that joined the wisdom of thousands, and the great attempt at binding their dreams to power.<br>What hides here is more than lies, but also the future of humanity, burning like the sparks of hope...<br><br>Dreams will always dissolve, their landscapes fated to collapse — this is the true meaning of the blooming flowers.<br>Only by suffering through the destruction of a god's delusions can humanity learn to rise against divine will...<br>Just as the stubborn God King orchestrated this secret rebellion, surviving on the strength of individual will alone.<br>However, the Lord of Flowers never knew a love that could be as sweet as wine, let alone the paltriness of human emotion.<br>Brilliant as she was, even she could not easily predict when these little beings would finally realize the truth...<br><br>\"... Have these so-called gods not been superfluous to you since the beginning?\"<br>"

Why do you bray at the winds to stop them from blowing?\"<br>\"Just like this hourglass. Should these crystal sands mingle into a congealed whole, what would be the meaning of its existence then?\"<br>\"Eternity is no paradise, but something that is nigh-impossible to deconstruct, an obstinate stain that cannot be mended.\"<br>\"Those who bloom like flowers, die like flowers, and rise again with the seasons like flowers can never be troubled by the likes of 'death.'\"<br><br>Once, in a moment in time, the three companions engaged in idle chatter, their words seized by the flowing winds of the desert and carried across the annals of time...<br>Somewhere in a faraway desert, the imaginings of a time-petrified oasis remains in the minds' of a tribe,<br>Yet these rootless wandering people continue the cycle of life and death amidst the flowing sands of the dunes...<br>"
