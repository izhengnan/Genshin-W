                "<br>Once there was an age when the silver wheels that guided the primal heavens yet remained three.<br>At that time, the laws bestowed from the heavens had yet to be assembled, and the boundaries of humanity had yet to be defined.<br><br>The sons and daughters of the gods were scattered across the newly-wrought gardens and valleys, their number countless.<br>The envoys of the sky walked among benighted human crowds then, sowing prosperity and wisdom.<br>In the end, the prosperity promised by the gods kindled the flame of intellect, which in turn stirred the whispers of doubt.<br><br>In quest of the answer, the people chose their priests; in fear of the answer, the priests anointed their kings.<br>Mortal folly stirred the ire of the gods' envoys. Faced with their questions, the divine envoys uttered no word.<br>And so the people turned their gazes toward the sky, offering sacrifices to the three bright moons in the dark, sunless night.<br><br>Above the night sky, the daughters of dreams and poetry kept vigilant, unceasing watch over the mortal world's every change.<br>In the deep slumber of the Arianrhod Realm, at the foot of the seventy-tiered staircase, beside the gleaming silver vessels.<br>Until they heard that the hearts of these pitiful little humans would also stir with the lunar quakes...<br><br>The night cast its eyes upon the earth, just as the silver stars once lit the way for the dragons' sky-faring ships.<br>They brought madness and inspiration back beneath the moon. It was a reply that Order could not give.<br>When the morning star rose again, the archpriest returned from the mountain's summit with a small circular talisman.<br>This \"Moon Wheel\" was the new pact between the three moons and the people."

                "<br>Once there was an age when the silver wheels that guided the primal heavens yet remained three.<br>At that time, The Winged One who tread upon morning stars and dwelt high above the moon became the Lord of the Eternal Heavens.<br><br>The Ark was moored, the matter of creation complete. The mountains and rivers were wrought in their turn.<br>Beneath the earth and deep within the seas dwelt the fallen clans and broken kings of the Old World.<br>The Lord of the World within the eggshell drew a false veil to shut out the true, bedeviled skies,<br>Obscuring dread that once robbed kings of sleep, even those who held dominion over beasts.<br><br>The sun's fierce light swept the heavens clean, but the freshly forged throne still reserved a place in the sky for the Three Sisters of the Moonlit Night.<br>Perhaps by its design, even a world where the elements surge in perfect order still needed tides.<br>The Lectors of Thirty Nights knew that alone, they could not protect this lonely, desolate planet from the inevitable doom that approached.<br>Before the coming of the final extinction, no victor in the struggle of good and evil could be worse than the doom of falling together into eternal oblivion.<br>Perhaps their former lord, shrouded in mist, would never find the answer. Or perhaps that answer was already at hand.<br><br>As they had hoped, the great ruler of the firmament spurned the destroyer veiled in black mist.<br>No doubt, through its long voyage across the shadowed realms, it had witnessed countless stars meet their end.<br>And so, they too chose Order. Or, more accurately, made space to accommodate it.<br>That was the age when the three moons shared governance with the morning star. That was the age when Eternity was yet Eternity."
