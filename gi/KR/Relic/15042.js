                "<br>That was a time when the gentle frost-light still lingered, a silver mirror unbroken, even as the golden realm had already fallen.<br>In a single night, the glorious golden tower fell like a fig tree. Across the frozen northern plain,<br>From the holy citadel to the ancient capital, dark blue crystal nails annihilated every last city with even the most minuscule sign of life.<br>The once-praised apostle and the gods' first messenger both vanished in the catastrophe.<br>Those who survived by grace of being nowhere near the cities at the time could only cling to life amidst the freezing wind and snow.<br>With no refuge left to them, they simply waited for destruction to find them in the hollow dark.<br><br>This is the great extinction spoken of in later prayers. Halcyon prosperity turned to dust,<br>And the gods remained silent, unmoved by cries, curses, or reproach.<br>In the despair of that long night, only one celestial ruler shed tears for the mortals' pain.<br>She was the mistress of the Frost Moon, queen of the celestial chariot and of light, a heavenly agent whose origin was one with that of the world.<br>Moved by pity, and a deeper, unspoken wish, she heeded the survivors' prayers.<br><br>According to legend, she spun gleaming threads from the silver glow to lead the displaced across the frozen plains.<br>And where her tears, full of longing, fell upon the frost-covered soil of the far north, they blossomed into lilies that would stand eternal in the icy winds.<br>The proud descendants of Hyperborea call themselves the \"Frostmoon Scions\" for this reason,<br>To honor the divinity who, whatever her original intent, gave them a new lease on life."

                "<br>That was a time when frost's gentle light had long shattered like a silver mirror, but when the new moon had yet to rise.<br>This is the story of two sisters who, born defective products, were never meant to be blessed.<br><br>In the moonlight, an undisturbed sanctuary for strangers, the fragile souls shared a single breath.<br>In the brief moments between agonies, moments that should have been filled with joy, they huddled together, drawing what little warmth they could from each another.<br>They had never seen their parents, and nor had they ever heard the wind whispering through the groves.<br>The two of them had only their grandmother, and the only way they'd seen the world was through the pages of a faded storybook.<br><br>Its brittle, yellowed pages, torn and tattered, revealed to them a world they'd never seen:<br>There it was, a single white bird, a streak of grace, gliding beneath a perfect moon.<br>As they admired the free creatures of the fairy tales, the two children made a promise to each other...<br>One day, the two of them would fly together like the white birds in the vast sky.<br><br>\"Since the day we were born, it's always been just the two of us.\"<br>\"When the day comes for us to leave, let's live the rest of our lives together.\"<br><br>Many years later, one of them broke their promise, leaving for a faraway place alone.<br>But alas, this was no flight toward a brighter future, but a fall into a much darker night.<br>With her went half the dream, and half the pain meant for them both.<br>Aila, later to become the first Moonchanter, began to endure twice the torment from that day on.<br><br>\"So you lied to me all along as well... My older sister, the only one I ever truly trusted.\"<br>\"But I won't resent you... I have long lost hope for the sky beyond.\""

                "<br>That was a time when frost's gentle light had long shattered like a silver mirror, but when the new moon had yet to rise.<br>It was then that the great plan, carried through countless generations since the time of extinction, was on the verge of culmination.<br><br>The bloodline, purified for over a thousand years, would at last give birth to the chosen one destined to reign over Elysium.<br>The false sevenfold radiance of the high heavens would fall at her feet, and the bones of the earth would rise to follow her.<br>For from her would spring union with the world, and from her would the first great cause be rebuilt.<br>That was the sacrosanct duty that had been passed down to the daughters of the far north. So it should have been. So it should have been...<br><br>But on a moonless, snowbound night, the girl chosen to bear the sacred heir met the boy from the northern realm,<br>And in his eyes, as clear as a winter's day, she beheld a reflection of a self she had never known.<br>This unfamiliar stirring was enough to make the holy woman turn her back on destiny for that young officer from afar.<br>For this new feeling, this foolishness called love, she cut off her bloodstained antler-crown and cast it down upon the snowy earth.<br><br>The fallen one, who had betrayed her own people, ultimately failed to fulfill her destined duty.<br>She was captured by a spy sent by the mad monk and was soon to be returned to the homeland she was meant to love.<br>But as she looked down at the officer by her feet, crimson pooling beneath him, she drew the dagger to her throat in one final, fatal kiss.<br><br>And so, the woman who failed to bear the sacred heir was buried in haste, her death forestalling the prophecy.<br>Fortunately, the leaders of every generation had long prepared for premature end of such a blessed lady.<br>Lovia, the then-Archpriestess, swiftly turned to a lesser branch of the bloodline for spares.<br>But the twin sisters born of this lineage were a pale shadow of the one they were meant to replace.<br><br>Hundreds of years might now have to pass before another child of sufficient purity was born.<br>Seeing the glory of the great endeavor slip from her grasp like dissipating dew,<br>The antler-crowned Archpriestess, maddened by anguish and obsession, hatched a terrible scheme.<br>Why wait for the thousand winds to sweep through several generations? If they were too impure,<br>Their flesh and blood too weak to bear the radiance of true moonlight... Did the Frost Moon's boon not linger faintly in all ███?<br>Then let ███ purify their ███!<br><br>Thus, in the name of flawless moonlight, the priestess committed an act so profane,<br>That even the mistress of the Frost Moon would recoil in horror at the blasphemy..."

How he drank bitter wine and fought for the freedom of his compatriots!\"<br>\"Like him, you must embrace this joyous pain, for from it, perfection will one day be born.\"<br><br>The two could no longer tell what filled the ancient silver goblet.<br>But if the kindly grandmother said so, then it must also be the will of the gods.<br>Yes, yes. All to sculpting perfection, to fulfill a wish that had endured a thousand years.<br>For the sake of the prophesied Elysium and the king destined to descend upon the world, impurity and trial had first to be transcended..."
