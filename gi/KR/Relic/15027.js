The beloved and vile alike are all crushed under the weight of a mill like wheat husks.\"<br><br>The sapphire sea is wreathed in a fog of lies, which go on to become legends and history—<br>A general, once the conqueror of countless cities, was left with but a slave to guide the way,<br>While a young slave bore the \"key\" to restoring their homeland...<br>The king who died absurdly because of a hunting falcon was left with bloodied knife marks along his throat,<br>And the dancer who made a vow to the prince cared only for the hatred she felt toward the tyrant...<br><br>Mortal hands were molded into the shape of a falcon, and the broken Jinni was infused within it.<br>From the cliffs of Gurabad it rose with a cry, sailing past the pitiable desert states...<br>Finally arriving in the hands of gilded descendants, the lost memories flaking off like sand.<br>The man-made feather lay upon a dune, silently proclaiming the end of nations...<br><br>Through an aged voice, the lost prince recalled the palace burning in his homeland,<br>His master at the time had been a general and a poet, loyal to the tyrant who ruined his nation.<br>All things will have their rewards and repercussions.
