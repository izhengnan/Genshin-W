                "<br>In an age when solemn songs were sung from the clifftops, a meteorite once fell into the Chasm.<br>Out of the depths of the boundless night sky above, the iron meteorite plummeted to the ground, turning the earth to Glazed Sand Crystal on impact.<br><br>Though human life is fleeting, Rex Lapis personally ordered the Millelith to rush to the defense of the mines.<br>As the Abyss flooded forth, the Millelith escorted countless civilians to safety.<br>Miners tell tales of a small number of troops from the rearguard, who remained in the Chasm.<br>Together with the nameless yaksha, they fought courageously until they, too, made the ultimate sacrifice among the jagged rocks.<br><br>In time, the names of both mortals and adepti alike were forgotten. In time, even the mountains and rivers change form.<br>Yet there will never come a time when their honorable deeds shall be forgotten. Like this gold-leafed flower, they will shine on forever.<br>500 years on, the harbor city remains as steadfastly peaceful today as the day the disaster was quelled.<br>And still, the troops wear this golden flower with pride, in honor of the sacrifice made by their forebears.<br>"

They boost the morale of the citizenry and fill visiting outlanders with a sense of awe.<br><br>It is said that in its inception, this ceremonial custom was inspired by the nameless yaksha.<br>In the heat of battle, when the yaksha was engaged in fierce combat with the Abyss, some of its plumage was stripped away. The feathers that fell to the ground were seen as a symbol of hope.<br>In the end, the brave yaksha and fearless citizenry would sink into an exhausted slumber in the dark lair of the enemy.<br>Rex Lapis was moved by their sacrifice and observed a prolonged vow of silence among the low murmuring of the mountain stone.<br>The people claim that the nameless yaksha that defended The Chasm was not, in fact, under the command of Rex Lapis.<br>Instead, they believe that it was an act of redemption from a longstanding sin... a price paid for cowardice and dereliction of duty.<br><br>Whatever the truth of the matter, the yaksha that had once soared through celestial heights had now returned to a free existence amongst the clouds.<br>As for the soldiers, trapped in eternal slumber in the depths of The Chasm... their legend continues to evolve with the flow of time."

They too drank from that golden cup.<br>It was a final toast to the benevolent and majestic Lord of Geo. With their gaze fixed ahead of them, they stormed into the abyss.<br>Hundreds of years later, a conceited adventurer retrieved the cup from the depths of The Chasm and washed away the imperfections.<br>Miraculously, the cup remained whole and untarnished by the passage of time. The pitch-dark of that subterranean realm had failed to remove its radiance.<br><br>Yet more centuries passed. Eventually, the people of Liyue would tell tales of an era of catastrophe and a nameless yaksha,<br>Tales of how heroes from disparate heritages and different lands united under a single banner against the Abyss...<br>Inevitably, the tale would touch upon the cup, and how the blood of those that went before remained clear and spotless as the day it was spilled.<br>"
