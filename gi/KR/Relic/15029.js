Don't fight.\"<br>The two who would always play the knight and the fell dragon nodded reluctantly.<br>\"And when I'm not around, ███, you'll take care of ███, won't you?\"<br>\"The Director and I will be back once we have finished attending to business, so don't go running outside.\"<br>The Vice Director thought for a moment, and plucked the dark green feather from her hat before departing.<br>\"You've wanted this for a while, haven't you, ███? Alright then. Here you go.\"<br>\"But I'm only giving this to you for safekeeping for a while, alright? I'll be quite cross if it gets dirty.\"<br><br>But in the end, this feather would never become the mystical staff used by some evil mage.<br>It would instead follow its new owner and reach the source of that which caused the calamity of parting, before returning to from whence it came..."

Narcissus was infuriated by this, and so sent out his minions and enforcers to scour the empire for her treasure. He set up many defensive mechanisms using his fell sorceries to prevent those on the side of justice from resisting him. He swore that he would reclaim the princess' treasure and reawaken her. That way, he would be able to claim her wholly for his own.\"<br>\"There was a group of heroes who protected a treasure that the princess had entrusted to them, a clear, bright pearl of water.\"<br>\"One day, a tiny life was born from this pearl.\"<br>\"Hmm... and what shall we call this life? Ah, what a pain. If I had known that this was how the story might go, I should've used your name here. Do you have any other good friends?\"<br>\"'Friends, you say... Well, if that's what you need, I do have one. I think it would really fit here.'\""

And at last, he will say:<br>\"Yes, hatred shall not fill me. I know that you have not seen the sights I have, and that is why you wish to stop me.\"<br>\"The star-beasts shall drink the amniotic fluid of the world dry. A hundred years from then, all life on its surface shall be wiped away.\"<br>\"I will surely return to save all souls. Ten years, even a hundred years may pass, but I shall be reborn as a new universe.\"<br><br>But the hero, victorious over the dragon, will also lose the thing most precious to him during the hunt.<br>He will never again believe in anything that the sum of human knowledge cannot completely grasp and understand,<br>And to the end of his days, he shall conceive of a kingdom powered by machines and energies not derived from the elements."
