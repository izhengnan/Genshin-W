Its core is adorned with pure pearls.<br>The songs of Watatsumi Island say that these flowers bloom in the pearl-lit depths.<br>Steeped in the lovesickness of the diving sea-daughters and the gentle moonlight, they would give off a pearly gleam.<br><br>When all conflicts have ceased, the sea beasts shall no longer weep for their lonesome companions,<br>And when the moonlight rises over Touzan, the lovely deity shall rise and sing.<br>\"Come, sea-daughters, come and see, O people of my heart, for the moon is out tonight.\"<br>\"Though Touzan might fall this night, the lightning and the storm can never hide the moon's pearly glory...\"<br><br>The lonesome maiden will sing and dance upon the moon-silver waves.<br>The divers shall forget the pain of loss, and even the tender flowers will regain their vibrance."
