        "<br>\"This is a story from Valuka...\"<br><br>This is a story from many moons ago, when the jungle was still a shining desert of gold, and we had not yet been born from the pomegranates.<br><br>There were once three friends. They were as good a group of friends as Araji, Aramaha, and Arayama.<br>But one of the friends returned to the earth, while the remaining two went their separate ways.<br>One was determined to create a kingdom on earth and cause all sorrow to disappear,<br>While the other decided to spread vegetation and greenery and fill the land with wisdom and happiness.<br><br>But eventually, kingdoms will fall, wisdom will be distorted, and the definition of happiness will change.<br>You will forget your dreams, while we will recoil back to ours, forgetting the sun and moon.<br><br>Even so, in the depths of the desert, just as the kings of the forest leave footprints behind, and you and I leave stories behind,<br>The traces of our past friendship are said to slumber quietly, like an Aranara that has transformed into a seed."
