        "<br>It is said that water has no fixed color or form, and can either serve brilliantly as blade or bow.<br>Out of all the substances in the world, water alone is the gentlest, and also the keenest.<br>Among the many curious weapons of the world, this fine bow has the inscrutable ability to summon water.<br><br>\"It can envelop all that is impure, wash away all filth, while maintaining its own purity.\"<br>\"It can change into any form, imitate any life, capricious, yet never losing its true self.\"<br>\"Divided, it is as streams uncounted, close yet untangled. United, it is as a giant wave, inexorable and unstoppable.\"<br>\"Many secrets that no light may penetrate hide beneath the azure translucence.\"<br>\"This is the mystery of water, that even a thousand brilliant minds may fail to grasp its myriad shifts.\"<br><br>Before she began working for the noble mistress of the Jade Chamber, she once heard an elderly senior expound on this teaching.<br>Hidden reefs and storms ever stalk the world of mercantile schemes and plays for power, and the skeletons of ships dot the seabed.<br>Those whose hearts brim with great ambition and sit on vast hoards of resources can often sail skillfully through in safety,<br>Avoiding the ever-ubiquitous competition and malice, soaring through the turbulent currents.<br><br>\"That's what they say, but I lack the spirit that these big shots have, nor have I the patience for the necessary tedium.\"<br>\"I'd much prefer enjoying the ambiance and aroma of a roomful of tea, and remain fascinated by the infinite possibilities that stem from the throw of six-sided dice.\"<br>\"I have infiltrated many a crook's hiding place by night, and broke the schemes of enemies from faraway lands upon my knee.\"<br>\"But I did not do these things to help the powerful and mighty get rid of dissident forces, but because water, too, has its source.\"<br><br>It is in defense of the purity of the source that water's gentleness can also become as blade and bow.<br>Conspiracy and coded language are interwoven with ease under the pale blue full moon — this is the wisdom of water's shape."
