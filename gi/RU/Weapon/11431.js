        "<br>Long, long ago, in what now is seen as an age of myth, when great dragons still roamed the deep valley,<br>There lived a girl who — despite having had her ankles mutilated at birth — inherited the title of Holy Sovereign, just as tradition dictated.<br><br>Back then, when the deep valley had not yet been given the name of \"Mictlan,\" there was but a lowly village that owed its very existence to the protection of the dragons.<br>By ancient beacons was the dragons' prideful honor incinerated, driving them to flee fearfully into withering dreams.<br>So did they come to make a pact with the mortals who sought their protection, instructing them to ordain a Holy Sovereign of exceptional talent...<br><br>\"A labyrinth of mirrors and a fortress of mist, these shall we build to shield your tiny mortal tribes from the scourge of war.\"<br>\"In return, we ask only one thing — that you choose a Sovereign who will guide us into our dreams.\"<br><br>As with all worldly aspirations, dreams are windows onto an inferno of desire, fired by the kindling known as \"life.\"<br>This so-called fated Sovereign was but an offering to dreams, destined to be dispersed like smoking embers by the cold night wind.<br>And so it was that the Holy Sovereign's only companions were a flute and her silent attendant.<br>Perhaps out of loyalty, or perhaps sympathy, he never left his young master's side, doomed as she was to an early demise.<br><br>Yet this hero, venerated by future generations, did not yet know that the young seer had long since discerned how the dream would end.<br>Until the hero passed through mist and mirrors, guided by her flutesong — only then did the girl who had lost her ankles embrace him.<br>And so, in a gentle song woven from whispers and the dainty night wind, she murmured into his ear all that she had heard...<br><br>\"...\"<br>\"When the day comes that we meet once more, pierce my heart, I beseech you. Let my name be engulfed by the flaming beacons and the burning winds.\"<br>\"The old pact shall be broken, and in its place you will establish a new one, bringing them true peace.\"<br>\"Until the day we meet once more, my most loyal servant Dinga, dragon slayer and fated Sovereign Maghan.\"<br>\"Hero of mine, and mine alone, this is my final command. May the name of Mictlan endure for millennia.\"",
        "<br>In the end, the dark night was devoured by the heat of the scorching sun. As the smoke dispersed, thus too did the sweetest of dreams dissipate, gone without a trace.<br>Even before the crimson flames had waned, the inhabitants of the village that had worshipped the dragons were denounced as traitorous enemies by the ruler of the Cinder City...<br>Shattered was the labyrinth of mirrors, crashing down in the face of the Python King's fury; so too did the fortress of mist crumble before his armies, sweeping through like the ocean tide.<br>Leading the charge was the hero Maghan, he who had once fought alongside the One Entombed With the Primal Fire, showing courage undiminished since yesteryear,<br>And before the dragons could awaken from their dream, he had slain the traitors who had made a pact with them, thus ending the conflict.<br>Yet granted a royal audience, the aging hero would not receive the favor that was offered by the Cinder City's ruler, instead simply seeking a chance to atone:<br><br>\"My lord, I failed in my endeavor to catch those beasts; they escaped into the depths of the smoke-shrouded valleys.\"<br>\"Though once a dragon slayer, now I am old and frail, unfit to serve the alliance any longer. Please permit me to retire on account of this.\"<br><br>This was the origin of Mictlan, one of the six great tribes in the thousand years to come.<br>As for how, when the Cinder City fell, the priest Maghan's successor renewed the pact with the dragons,<br>And how, according to his wishes, he was buried amongst unmarked graves, rather than being returned to the Sacred Flame;<br>That is another story altogether, completely unrelated to Maghan the dragon slayer.<br><br>\"I dream of a katun without fear... the city of jade shall be established where the sun rises, and a new lord shall be born twice.\"<br>\"The golden emissary shall come, the green bird shall come, Aq're Q'aq shall come. It is the promise of the night.\"<br>\"I dream of your descendants... free from fears of smoke and phantasms, no longer in tears, no longer in pain.\"<br>\"The master of flames and blazing infernos... will protect the dreams of humans and dragons alike, watching over them until the stars cease to turn.\"<br>\"Hero of mine, and mine alone, this is my final vision. Please make this future a reality.\"<br>\"...\""
