Unheard torture.<br>An all-engulfing sorrow crushed the poisoned Dvalin's spirit.<br><br>Dvalin turned on what he had vowed to protect,<br>And accused the one to whom he had sworn loyalty:<br>\"Indifferent is Barbatos to my pain! A careless friend is he!\"<br>\"Curse you, Barbatos, cruelest of the Archons!\"<br><br>The furious friend knew not that Barbatos sought to save him.<br>For many fond memories may have been quashed by Dvalin's anguish, but not that of Barbatos' lyre. The Holy Lyre der Himmel.<br>Soon, centuries of misunderstanding shall be gone.<br>Soon, Dvalin shall hear once more his songs.<br>"
