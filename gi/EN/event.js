A character with sufficient \"Eminence\" will become an \"Exalted One,\" granting them a powerful \"Eminent Boon\" in Normal, Advancing, Hard, Menacing, and Fearless challenges, which will assist players in completing them quickly. There can be a maximum of 16 \"Exalted Ones\" at any one time, and when data updates occur, characters with the most \"Eminence\" will become the new \"Exalted Ones.\"<br>3. Co-Op Challenges: \"Stygian Onslaught\" allows multiple players to form a team and attempt a Co-Op Mode challenge. In a Co-Op Mode challenge, different players cannot select the same character. They will all be affected by any \"Ley Line Disturbances.\" Additionally, the combat power of your opponent(s) will be changed to that of the Co-Op challenge for the corresponding difficulty. This combat power will not change according to the number of challenge participants.<br>4. Disturbance Outbreak Rewards: In the 10 days after the challenge is available, the Ley Line Disturbance will be in an \"Outbreak\" state. Players with Adventure Rank 45 and above can challenge stages at \"Hard\" difficulty onwards, and upon completing them, can use Original Resin, Condensed Resin, Fragile Resin, Transient Resin, or Primogems to revitalize special disturbance-affected Ley Line Blossoms and obtain rewards from their chosen Domains of Blessing. They will also accumulate Dire Prestige, which will let them obtain more rewards.",
