You have but a human body, and yet you carry such a power within you.\"<br>\"You claim that you have no tears left to cry, no blood left to shed, but surely this is because you have filled yourself with fire...\"<br>\"Though your body has long been covered in scars, fierce flames are all that now may flow, like molten iron, from your eyes and your wounds.\"<br>\"But we appear to have gotten off-topic. I followed the trail of smoke and tracked you down because I wish to strike a deal with you...\"<br>\"Let the flames that now devour you be extinguished by the grace of Her Majesty. What say you?\"<br><br>The first Fatuus gave power to a young woman in whom the flame of life had all but died,<br>And in her wild imagination, she saw the line that lay between the corrupt past and a stainless future...<br><br>\"I understand. Then, let glacial ice take the place of my erased past and extinguish these undying flames.\"<br>\"Let the darkness of corruption, the pain of the world, and the humans, beasts, and the sin they carry all be purified by silent ice.\"<br><br>But despite this, a pure white flame continued to burn within her heart...<br><br>\"We share the same goal, you, your Tsaritsa, and I.\"<br>\"Cleanse the sources of distortion in this world: short-sighted, ignorant gods and the darkness and corruption of the Abyss.\"<br>\"Good. I will do whatever it takes to become an effective instrument in the advancement of our common cause.\"<br>\"For even if I dress in pure white from head to toe, the ashes of the dead that have long left their stain on every inch of my being can never be cleansed.\"<br>"

As anticipated, no research breakthroughs are possible, given the working style of the Akademiya.<br>II. Nevertheless, being expelled would be a loss. One needs an environment conducive to research.<br><br>Following a trail of rumors of heresy, the first of the Fatui tracked him down...<br><br>\"Merely an enhanced human? If your great nation can furnish me with sufficient resources and ample time, I could even manufacture that which you would call a god. What say you?\"<br>In the desert that shone bright like liquid gold, he inquired of the Snezhnayan diplomat:<br>\"Will you treat me like the Akademiya did? Will you call me a monster, a madman?\"<br>\"Or will you treat me as my hometown did, and chase me away with pitchforks and clubs...?\"<br><br>However...<br>\"Good. Then, we are now in partnership.\"<br>\"As for the matter of your title — what do you say to this...\"<br>Taken completely by surprise by the sheer irony of the title he was given, the young man burst into hysterical laughter."
