Hence, illusory visions were born out of concrete reality.\"<br>\"The so-called omamori cannot make one's wishes come true at all, but they can make them eternal through this entanglement.\"<br><br>Seeing my befuddled expression, a picture of complete confusion, Lady Kitsune couldn't help bursting into laughter,<br>She cheerfully knocked my head with her pipe and sneakily changed the subject.<br><br>\"I suppose you've met your fated one as well, Hibiki?\"<br><br>\"What sort of 'fate' could there be with a rude and reckless brute like that!\"<br><br>\"Oh, is that so?\"<br><br>But darkness engulfed everything in the end.<br>That \"fate,\" too, was no more."

And time keeps moving like a spinning wheel.<br>Silent and tranquil, the Lady Kitsune's white form hidden in the deep darkness left a deep impression in the shrine maiden's dreams.<br>The Great Tengu went into self-imposed exile, enraged at her own incompetence as the Lady Saiguu's protector, leaving Teruyo behind.<br>Harunosuke left for another country amid the fury of his mourning, while Nagamasa joined the Shogunate to clear the Mikoshi name.<br>As for the man who taught me archery in the sacred forest and patiently listened to my naïve promise under the scarlet sakura boughs,<br>He will eventually return to me, even if he were to be blinded by splattered blood, or turned into a fierce beast by that dark defilement...<br><br>I shall save him with our bow and arrows, to keep our promise, which ever veers towards breaking.<br>I shall destroy evil with our bow and arrows, exorcising folly and needless obsession.<br><br>\"Come see me, you idiotic problem gambler.\"<br>\"And don't lose your way this time, Konbumaru.\"<br><br>Still, who won the last throw of the dice...<br>She touched the bow lightly while pondering such unimportant things."

All you have seen of me is but a residual vision, born of your wishes.\"<br><br>In that vague memory, she kept saying some incomprehensible things. Her expression as sorrowful as the eighth month's moon, and I suddenly...<br>Then she rapped me over the head with her tobacco pipe, wearing her usual expression of rebuke and mockery:<br><br>\"Hibiki, the sun's about to rise.\"<br>\"We should head back.\""

Thus, be it good or bad fortune, it will help them navigate their future.<br>In other words, there are only lost people, and no inaccurate fortunes.<br>I've learned a lot while studying at the shrine. Now, even someone as dull-witted as I am has learned how to talk like a mighty kitsune.<br>During this time, even someone as inhuman as the mighty Yougou Tengu has gotten a daughter.<br>Even that leatherhead Konbumaru has also become one of the Shogun's own Hatamoto, and shall soon marry the daughter of a high-ranking samurai.<br><br>\"Such a lovely kid. Even the great Yougou Tengu, who used to kill all day for fun, had the mother inside her brought out... just a little.\"<br>\"Still... the shrine is always missing the liveliness of children. That's not good. Say, Hibiki, how would you like to be a kid again?\"<br><br>The Lady Kitsune's joke was out of line as always, coming forth with the self-serving scent of sakura wine.<br><br>\"Aw, Hibiki, why the long face? How about this, then? I, the Lady Saiguu, shall tell your fortune for you!\"<br>\"Haha, see? See, it's \"Great Fortune.\" \"Great Fortune\"! You know what that means?\"<br>\"It means that you took away all the bad fortune slips. Please stop mocking me, Lady Saiguu.\"<br>\"No... it means that the person you're missing will be lucky enough to become a part of your memories forever.\"<br><br>That's why you have to be strong and must live on for a long, long time.<br>Even if all the people you cherish are gone, as long as you are still alive,<br>The time you spent with them will never perish..."

Love is fleeting, and even lasting memories may be lost.\"<br>\"Losing one's memory is no different from losing one's life. It is like death amidst darkness eternal.\"<br><br>This time, even a faint smile could not conceal her sorrow.<br>Though this is a festive day, it seems more like a farewell.<br><br>\"Right, then.
