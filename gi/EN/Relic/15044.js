Sharp winds held aloof the frozen heavens above.<br>Warriors were meant to obey their charge. To smother, in their very cradles, those rebels skulking in darkened alleys, those who dared shake the towering spire.<br>Yet at the songs that flowed from the strings of that young bard's lyre, the warrior laid down sword and blade.<br><br>Not by tongues of treason beguiled, nor by promises of illusion swayed,<br>The warrior yielded only to the caged bird's yearning for the sky, a hunger writ in the blood of every living creature.<br>Be they paupers, bowed by bitter winds and clinging to the side of the boy,<br>Or the maiden, wandering through pallid plains, calling upon a thousand winds and blossoms;<br>Be they a small sprite of the wind, heart stirred by the boy's music,<br>Or soldiers going no less hungry than those they were bid to subdue;<br>Be they old bards bereft of their eyes, or wandering craftsmen shorn of their hands,<br>Or sick and ailing souls, countless in number, their names lost to the wild winds' howl;<br>All alike, steeped in that song, gentle as the morning breeze, warm as dawn light seeping into cold nights,<br>Would lift their eyes as one and gaze upon the sky, still far above.<br>Even she, the God King's most favored confidant, that taciturn, iron-cold huntress, grim of tongue yet true of heart...<br>Surely, 'twas but by duress of her erstwhile master that her fair hands were stained with innocent blood.<br>For how else might a clutch of soft-spoken words have turned her away from the tyrant, and set her feet upon the path of those who stood against him?<br>Though ineloquent by nature, she too must have longed, like her companions, for a gentler dawn to come...<br><br>And so the silent warrior cast aside both duty and name, weaving her snare from within the shadows,<br>Gathering, for the boy who sang of morning, the winds scattered across the long night, until at last they rose to blow against the towering gale-wale.<br><br>\"Let the nameless flowers kiss away your tears, and grieve not for the parting that tomorrow brings.\"<br>\"Until the breath of dawn erases my name, and reveals for you the light that is true.\""

It was forged into a roaring defiance of the many, a tempest that no storm could rend asunder.<br><br>If mortal flesh could not transcend the seat of gods, if the song of \"this moment\" could not stay the hand of calamity,<br>Then let the desires of countless such \"moments\" merge with the yearning for liberty that echoes through unnumbered ages.<br>Let the bone-chilling hatred of a single instant be diffused into the long span of Time, as petals adrift upon the breeze.<br><br>In a single, extraordinary moment, the youth, whose very body became the instrument, strummed strings that once belonged solely to the Master of Time.<br>Even the Mother of the Thousand Winds was stunned, her eyes falling briefly upon the desolate northern lands.<br>That violent, fleeting storm transformed into a thousand-year-long poem of wind and hue,<br>Into breezes caressing clear springs and fragrant fruit wines, into the distant songs of pines and pastoral melodies across viridescent fields.<br>It became the sword that pierced both royal blood and venomous dragons, it became the solemn vows of old, and the sighs of lovers.<br>At the break of dawn, the symphony of a thousand years began its first note.<br>Its name is Mondstadt, and all who hold freedom in their hearts are its musicians.<br><br>But the flesh and blood of the first to strike the strings could not carry the weight of a nation's song.<br>The great symphony, summoning the usurped power of time, poured a moment's burning fury into a thousand-year instant.<br>The bard's body fell with the collapsing tower, and the name that ought to have endured was swept away by the winds of time.<br>Like frail snows melting upon the breath of spring, it was lost beyond recall of both memory and voice.<br>Only that tiny wind spirit, on the day when the Mother of Time and Wind bestowed her authority,<br>Claimed silently a strand of time from bygone days, along with the name that even the reversal of years could not save.<br><br>\"My dear friend, take now this breeze of a thousand years, and with it, a yearning for joy, and dreams of liberty.\"<br>\"Do not grieve for me. While the winds still blow, folk shall sing as I once did, of their hope for tomorrow.\""
