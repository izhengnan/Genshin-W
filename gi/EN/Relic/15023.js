I mean, you can't trust these baseless folktales, can you?\"<br>\"The merchants of Shenglu Hall have long left their obscurity and forgotten their past.\"<br>\"Glittering Sand Crystal cannot easily be made into lacquerware, after all, nor is it suited to making luxury paints.\"<br>\"According to the miners at The Chasm — and mind you don't believe this story too readily either—\"<br>\"This timepiece and sand crystal came from the Millelith five hundred years ago.\"<br><br>In the lightless abyss where light wrestled against darkness, even one with a Yaksha's might could not hold out for long.<br>And all the more did mere mortals need light to prevent them from getting lost in the steel curtain of devouring night.<br>The Millelith thus collected glowing sand to light the way, and it just so happened to resemble the pale moonlight.<br>The timepiece for its part told of the time they spent there in the abyss, and serves as proof that where they fell, others have come after to take up their duty."

Tianheng that even Rex Lapis praises.\"<br>\"But the heavens have graced us with stores of precious stones and marvelous jade, and we carve the jagged rock for a living.\"<br>\"Thanks to the grace of Rex Lapis, our lives are, while not ideal, at least free of terror.\"<br>\"Yet things have changed, and a dark shadow is cast over the blessing we have received from the fallen star.\"<br>\"We do not have any precious gifts to present as a pledge, but still we beg for your succor.\"<br><br>The guest heard the elders' plea, and silently drank every drop of that bitter wine.<br>The guest promised nothing, and did not chastise the mortals for their insolence, but simply turned east, disregarding all attempts to make them stay.<br><br>As for what came after, all now know what happened...<br><br>But the simple crystal-sand wine cup that the guest shared with the tribal elders remains to this day as a testament to their pact."
