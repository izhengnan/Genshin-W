                "<br>Mother had bared her fangs against the Shogun, who had been kind to her and who had given her a treasured sword.<br>In the end, the only thing that was sent back to the Mikoshi Clan was the tsuba of that blade which she had loved so dearly.<br><br>Mother's long-cherished wish was to overcome the destiny of life and death with her boiling passion.<br>She would make such contributions as to make an eternal name for the ever-thinning blood of the war-oni.<br>If she was engulfed by the pitch-black tiger-beast of sin itself, then she would tear it apart from the inside.<br><br>She would've proven her valor resoundingly under the Electro Mitsudomoe banner,<br>And she thought she could wash her bloodstained juunihitoe battle-garb clean.<br>But it was stained black in the end, together with her fiercely beating heart...<br><br>From then on, her eldest son, who should have inherited the family fortune, lived in seclusion in a village outside the city,<br>With naught but the mountain and wood as his friends — that is, until he met that girl...<br><br>\"What a pain. Well, if you wish to abandon your past, allow me to give you a new name.\"<br>After hearing about his past, the girl who possessed jet black wings sneered disdainfully.<br>\"Well, you shall be called Iwakura. 'The seat of rock.' A name that human words cannot harm.\"<br>\"Come on, mortal in whose veins runs the blood of the oni, be glad. Smile a little!\"<br>\"You should know that names given by us Yougou Tengu are blessed with divine powers.\"<br>\"Besides, the name 'rock' suits you — it certainly suits your mind and your muscles, that's for sure.\"<br><br>\"Well then, when the cherry blossoms fall next year, let's have a duel here, 'Iwakura.'\"<br>\"Child of the oni, hone your swordsmanship and become a foe whom the Yougou Tengu would not be ashamed to cross swords with.\"<br>\"Ah, yes! If you manage to touch me, you'll get to call your secret blade 'Tengu Victor'!\"<br>\"After all, if you get to that point, you'll have a sword that'll let you 'triumph over the tengu.'\""

                "<br>Surrounded by the black feathers seized by his onrushing blade, the man who stood on the cusp of becoming a swordmaster...<br>...Finally caught the girl who had been untouchable for so many years...<br><br>\"Yikes, that was a close shave. Well done indeed.\"<br>\"If your sword hadn't been broken by your strength,\"<br>\"I would've died here for sure. Well then...\"<br><br>Teruyo, shall we change the venue for our duel next year?<br>There are a few places I know of where you can also see the scarlet sakura falling...<br>As he looked around at the small shrine he had destroyed, holding the tengu's trembling hand,<br>These words lay on the tip of Michihiro's tongue even as he stared at the black feathers that he had sliced off.<br><br>\"You did touch me, after all. I must admit that this is clearly your victory.\"<br><br>Victory has not been decided yet. Let's meet again next year, he wanted to say.<br><br>\"Now, your sword can even surpass the speed of a tengu.\"<br>\"I will never forget a single one of our duels in these past thirteen years.\"<br>\"But as a Tengu, I have duties to the clan that I must fulfill.\"<br>\"Thinking back, I changed your name in hopes that you might escape from the curse of the oni bloodline.\"<br>\"With that war, non-human blood grows thinner and thinner.\"<br>\"Ah well. We should not covet the happy endings that humans enjoy, after all. But you're different.\"<br>\"You are now 'Iwakura.' You are no longer the 'Mikoshi' who shoulders the burden of oni blood.\"<br><br>\"Goodbye, Michihiro, and please forget me.\"<br>\"Use your sword for the Iwakura bloodline... and open a path that belongs to the Iwakura alone.\""

                "<br>In the distant past, when Seirai Island had yet to be shrouded by storm clouds, memories would rise and fall like breaths.<br>In the end, the elegant container that contained thunderstorms and tremors could not be handed over to the one to whom it was promised.<br><br>\"Did you come to me because the string is broken again? You're such a headache.\"<br>\"Other than your swordsmanship, you're just an idiotic old gambler, aren't you?\"<br><br>\"Hmph. Don't you look down on me. I learned my archery from a tengu, you know? It's pretty famous, too.\"<br>\"It's just that I'm too good with a sword, you know? That's why no one ever talks about my archery.\"<br>\"Actually, now that I think about it, that's such a waste of good archery. How about I teach it to you, then?\"<br><br>Once upon a time, you mended that idiot's broken seal cage, all the while speaking those harsh words...<br>Once upon a time, though you used harsh words to divert others, you could not help but smile faintly.<br><br>\"Please. You're already a Hatamoto with important responsibilities. Why are you still running around looking for trouble?\"<br>\"And you're already married too, to a sweet wife no less. Why do you spend your days wandering and gambling, huh?\"<br><br>You're already...<br>The question was on the edge of your lips, but you were unable to ask, and you decided never to bring it up again.<br>If the Lady Saiguu had been here with you, she would surely have put it in a clever and merry way...<br><br>\"It doesn't matter anymore. I gave myself a holiday, at least for today.\"<br>\"Let's leave that whole shrine business behind and sneak off to the seaside, just like we did when you were little.\"<br><br>And so he dragged you to the harbor, where you watched the ships sailing back and forth, as if in a trance.<br>You listened to him talk about Teruyo of the shrine, and how she had inherited her master's beauty and skill.<br>You listened to him talk about his terrifying nightmares, in which he cut off his own head...<br>But you both knew that those were just words to hide the melancholy of adulthood.<br><br>Later, a long time later,<br>Overlooking the mossy reefs and the harbor where the two of you once had that quiet rendezvous...<br>For the gambler to win his bet again, for the sake of praying for his safety...<br>Once again, you dared to stand upon those heights, holding up the seal cage that you made with your own hands.<br>Bearing the hope of retrieving those memories, you gathered the power of thunder and lightning."

Not even once.\"<br><br>\"Is that so? In that case, where does the name of your secret blade, 'Tengu Sweeper,' come from?\"<br>Seeing that Douin did not answer, the Kanjou Head who had built Ritou up said:<br>\"Ah, if it wasn't for old man Kujou making a move first, I would've loved to recruit you.\"<br>\"With your sword, even Ako Domeki of Seirai would be no match...\"<br><br>Cleaving through the storm clouds, that tengu had given him a new name and a new life.<br>She threw him the rusty blade and told him to strike her, a tengu, down.<br>And after his sword broke, these were her last words to him..."
