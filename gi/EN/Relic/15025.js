The whispers that preach \"death\" became lost within this labyrinth,<br>For only she and those who understood the teachings of the forest lord could pass through the maze and enter into the boundless hunting grounds.<br>Till at last, when the whispers had faded, and the wicked beasts had fled far away, did she, now fully eroded, disappear together with that grand dream.<br><br>She, and many fragments of dreams, would at last flow into the dreams of human scions.<br>Like how a shattered mirror reflects many different images,<br>The dreams she left behind are circulated through the narratives of the people in a myriad of forms.<br>Those tales that became the widest spread (emerged victorious) had nothing at all to do with her.<br><br>Her name as mentioned in those tales, for example, was in fact the name of the crown.<br>In the end, all she had left to herself was her true name, a handful of water that reflected the moonlight,<br>And the golden flower she had taken from the crown that her beloved king had given her."

                "<br>Those were the years of the lord of the labyrinth...<br>It is said that the most virtuous and visionary of the royal servants was a young girl who could understand the language of all beasts and read the poetry of moonlight.<br>She guarded the silent forest, the still water that embraced the moon, and the endless hunting grounds at the very end of the dream forest.<br>\"We were born in the verdant royal forest. Our world is under the tree-shade and above the meadow.\"<br>\"That which comes from the forest must return to it. As long as we follow the laws of nature, then we shall not fear death.\"<br>\"For all those who follow nature must pass through the maze of the forest and reach that endless plain.\"<br>Her teachings once inspired many children, but like the blood of tigers, it too would slowly grow thin...<br><br>Those were the years of the ominous moon...<br>They say that the blind boy followed in the footsteps of his white-armored brother, traversing kingdoms, mountains, and rivers,<br>At last becoming lost in the dark forest.<br>He was obsessed with swordsmanship but was gentler than anyone. He was too dogmatic, but adhered to justice more than anyone...<br>At the end of the everlasting, white phantom in his heart, what he discovered was a relic of the woods, pure white as the moonlight.<br>Later, there came beasts that lusted after flesh and blood. When the huntress finally came to him, following the shimmering light of the white branches,<br>He had already lost the power to make wishes, and the white form that once guided him had faded into darkness and disappeared...<br><br>Those were the years when the night was on the rise. Those were the years when dawn was still far-off.<br>From the nightmare, the wise caught a glimpse of the dark longsword and the red blooming in the water."
