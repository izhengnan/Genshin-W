Past slaves shall be future masters.\"<br>\"Our race is mired in spiraling contradiction inexorable. Only in sowing seeds shall we find salvation.\"<br>\"Perhaps, out there in the abundant primordial wilderness, there is a land that has yet to know the touch of filth and decay.\"<br><br>Thus, passing through searing flame and raging wind, it took as-yet unextinguished primordial kindling from the ancient palace beneath the magma.<br>Bearing the hopes of another race, the wisest of dragons bid farewell to the splendorous city ineffable."

It would civilize these barbarians, but it would also order their destinies.<br>For unlike the plan of that first divine one, what the most sage one brought was the profane path of \"evolution,\"<br>Its far sight had divined that at the end of that path, human blood would be poured into the derelict body of the moribund earth,<br><br>Merging two species and two bloodlines as one, and thus would an ancient pulse surge through a reborn civilization.<br>Indeed, it would be as the wisest one said unto the first barbarian who climbed upon the floating landmass to visit it:<br><br>\"But from your heirs shall come the savior of two worlds. He shall be brutal as the lions and scorpions, but as cunning as a wild fox.\"<br>\"One day, he shall slay the overlord of fire and ascend to the oldest of thrones. Praise be unto the ruler of two worlds!\""

His tribe had scattered, and none now sang of his saga.<br>Only in the deepest nights could he hear that call from a faraway realm, as if to reignite the fading flame in his heart.<br>On the last night of his life, he climbed a high mountain to ignite the first flame. He called out, hoping to reunite with his former companions.<br>And the god of the night realm responded. That night, people throughout the land seemed to hear voices from another world,<br>Like a mother's clear song, like the low whispers of old friends — the birth-cry of the first Wayob of the Night Kingdom."
