        "<br>Long, long ago, in what now is seen as an age of myth, when great dragons still soared above the canopy,<br>There lived a hero who — though he later came to be revered as the Firethief — was at that time still in his youth, and as reckless as a Halberd-Crest Bird.<br>Born strong, brave, and boastful, he would roam the woods, challenging passersby to duels,<br>Yet he was easily defeated by a half-human hero, the follower of a great warrior, who with cunning footwork lured him into a mire.<br><br>Seeing the young man in such a sorry state, the archer could not help but laugh;<br>Of habit so stern and taciturn, you would not have thought that he would tease others so.<br>Half of shame, half of annoyance, the young man made up his mind;<br>He would follow these oddballs, if only to cover up the shame of defeat.<br><br>\"Hey! You aren't seriously thinking of taking on that... Uh, whatever it is, without me, are you?\"<br>\"Listen up, you lot! I am Yupanqui, and it is I that is destined to shake the very foundations of the... Wait, I haven't finished!\"<br><br>Many years later, whenever he thought back upon that journey, he couldn't help laughing at how awkwardly childish he used to be.<br>More than once did his failure to heed advice land him in great danger; more than once did his boisterousness earn him the quiet artisan's annoyance.<br>Though it is true that countless enemies fell to the swings of his greatsword, on balance, his contributions were still outweighed by the trouble he caused.<br>Despite this, the companions who journeyed by the warrior's side tolerated his youthful ignorance.<br>When his vision was taken by the fire of delirium, it seemed to him that he heard the silent priest's words once more...<br><br>\"One day, you will understand why you embarked on this verdant path.\"<br>\"By past fuel, and present flame, life marches ever on.\"<br>\"We will answer to the fire for all our deeds. This is your path, and yours alone.\"",
        "<br>That was the age when the banners of all the tribes had returned to the corroded ruins of the Cinder City, when oaths had long since faded away.<br>Having gradually fallen into delirium, the human king now babbled of his crazed obsessions, his eyes reflecting naught but fear.<br>Though still given to lament how the grand vision he had once held — of humans and dragons coexisting — was now beyond reach,<br>Yet the aging hero could not bring himself to rebel against his only surviving friend of old.<br><br>In the end, he thought, the color would thus fade from all verdant paths.<br>In this way, passion is just like fire — despite regret and unwillingness, once extinguished, it is gone.<br>Just as there was no such thing as a flame that could itself be rekindled, so there would never be a path that was his, and his alone.<br>And thus, the disheartened old man silently accepted the idle position of ordnance officer for the Grand Alliance,<br>Resolving never to interfere with his old friend's orders again, waiting only for the day that he would return to the Sacred Flame...<br><br>Until, having saved the dragons from the shadow of the sword, alone at night came the scarlet-eyed youth to pay a visit to the ordnance officer's abode,<br>With that zeal, at once both strange and familiar, he pleaded with the old hero to break the chains of the broken oath.<br><br>Steadfast and taciturn, the old man did not answer him directly, only glancing at the dusty greatsword beside him.<br>In his eyes, over the long years glazed dull with gloom, a spark of fiery brilliance flashed up once more."
