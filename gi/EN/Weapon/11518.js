        "<br>By the time the little witch arrived at the Day King's palace, twilight had already taken hold.<br>Had she come any later, the kingdom would have already passed beyond the Day King's rule.<br>Before the night curtain descended, the Day King received her in what remained of his fleeting hours.<br><br>\"O witch who has traversed the vast cosmos, kindler of time's eternal flame... what brings you to this lonely planet?\"<br>\"I did not come of my own accord. It was the planet's cry that found me through the void. Answering its call, I crossed the gate of stars forgotten by time.\"<br>\"In a universe nearing its quiet end, every world that yet glimmers is a treasure beyond compare...\"<br>\"Who would have thought that in a region long considered dark and inhospitable, a living world would still endure?\"<br><br>But this was not the whole story. In truth, the little witch had caught wind of whispers from this dark expanse — whispers that had flown to her on the eve of the Night Carnival.<br>Under ordinary circumstances, she would likely have dismissed such strange signals as just another error from the scryglass.<br>But as the message reached her, she was fretting over the next day's festivities, desperately trying to find a way to avoid her nemesis, who would also be there.<br>So she seized the opportunity to hide away in her workshop — spending considerable effort deciphering this distant missive.<br>\"Hmm... So this peculiar message means that some unknown planet has been feeling unwell?\"<br><br>\"No matter what, the righteous Kingdom of Day would never do anything to harm the planet,\" the Day King said solemnly.<br>\"Perhaps you should ask the wicked Night King. This very morning I sent my army to vanquish him, alas...\"<br>But before he could finish, the last rays of the setting sun vanished into night, and the king's apparition melted away like cream.<br>With the curtain of darkness descending, the court itself vanished too. The ground boiled like a raging sea, and black smoke rose from the earth.<br>The entire planet became a vast black ocean. Fortunately, the little witch had remembered her broom — otherwise, she may well have plunged into the water.<br>Riding her broom beneath the blood-red moon, she traveled far before finally spying a lonely castle, glowing with firelight.<br><br>\"Vanquish the Night King? That's the easy part. What we have to do is far more important.\"<br>The castle seemed to have been built by the Day King's army. For unknown reasons, it had escaped dissolution by the sea of mist.<br>The leading warrior, carrying a sword on his back, was not at all surprised by the little witch's arrival. Instead, he met her with an invitation.<br>\"Even if we defeat the Night King, it changes nothing. As soon as the sun sets anew, the dark tides will swallow the land once more.\"<br>\"To break this endless cycle, we built this castle. From here, we can search for a solution.\"<br><br>At his invitation, the little witch descended to the deepest level of the castle, where — beyond its fragile boundaries — stretched a sea of pure darkness.<br>Sustaining this boundary was a massive mechanism that spat out an endless stream of smoke. Countless pipes were continuously drawing thick seawater into its core.<br>\"This is the perpetual motion machine, or you may call it the Holy Grail. By burning the seawater, it generates light and heat.\"<br>\"Since all tangible things on this planet are merely shadows cast by light, so long as we can create a fire that never goes out...\"<br>\"But doing this will only make the planet burn out even faster...\" the little witch sighed.<br>\"Once the sea's been drained, this place will be finished. There's nothing 'holy' about this so-called grail...\"<br>\"Now I know why the planet's been feeling unwell.\"<br><br>Before the warrior could react, the little witch drew the sword from his back and hurled it into the \"perpetual motion machine.\"<br>The warrior reached out to retrieve it, but the moment the blade touched the black sea mist, both he and the fading light vanished into nothingness.<br>The entire planet was once again swallowed by darkness. When daylight finally returned, it was as if everything from the previous night had been nothing more than a deep and distant dream.<br><br>\"I suppose that's a temporary fix, at least,\" the little witch murmured, glancing back one last time before leaving the planet on her broom.<br>In the morning light, the warrior — his shadow trailing long behind him — took up the sword bestowed by the Day King and set out on his journey once more.<br>\"This cycle may go on for a long, long time... until the day you too become nothing but an empty shell.\"<br>\"But no matter what, you must keep going. At least... you must live until we meet again.\""
