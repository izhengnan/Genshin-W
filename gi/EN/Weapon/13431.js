        "<br>Long, long ago, in what now is seen as an age of myth, when great dragons still swum the flowing springs,<br>There was a fairy who, having drifted to this place carrying a mission from a distant land, met with a valiant youth under the watery moonlight.<br>The young man was Uenuku of the Meztli, known to posterity as the Treader of the Rainbow.<br>Just as the spring waters have never taken a fixed form, so too are there many different versions of the legend of the Rainbow King, each with their own origins.<br>Yet invariably, they all mention his encounter with the water sprite.<br><br>\"I am a tear born of the primordial chalice, the daughter of clear springs, sweet dew, gentle winds, and light mist.\"<br>\"O hero, he who has embarked on a journey to protect the weak, the justice you pursue is the ideal I yearn for.\"<br>\"Please allow me to bless your spear with my song, and allow me to accompany you on this lonely journey.\"<br>\"I ask only that when you become King, as my reward, you grant me the spring where vicious beasts prowl.\"<br><br>For the Mistress of Many Waters' noble and compassionate vision, for the all-embracing love spread through the land along the flowing waters,<br>For these things, the searing waters must be turned into clear springs; the flowing phlogiston purged utterly from the water veins.<br>So, in the name of justice, was the warrior guided onto his journey, to challenge the order that belonged solely to the dragons—<br><br>Though he discerned the fairy's true intentions, realized that the Oceanid messenger merely saw him as a means to fulfill an end,<br>Since they shared a common enemy, he would fight by the side of this girl who sought to deceive him, until the time came that they were to betray one another.<br><br>And that was enough, he thought to himself. Even if all her words were simply designed to entice, and though it would eventually all dissipate into mist and rain,<br>At least the justice that he so firmly believed in, the justice that had the power to \"unite\" the weak; at least that would not fade at the journey's end.<br><br>It was only after dozens of winters had passed, and he had spent his life in vain trying to fulfill that promise, that the \"King\" realized—<br>At the end of that glorious journey, it was the unwavering faith he had held from the very beginning that he ultimately regretted the most.",
        "<br>Just as the spring waters have never taken a fixed form, so too do the hearts of humans and fairies sway with the night breeze.<br>Only when the young man was on the verge of being consumed by the dragonlord's flames did she realize that her objective had long since become muddled.<br>All she had to do was abandon the one with blind faith in justice here; after all, she had already advised him to abandon his village.<br>Then, she had simply to find another who could become King; after all, his ideals had never concerned her anyway.<br><br>But if that was the case, then why did she now face the dragon's fire for his folly, beheld by his astonished eyes?<br>Perhaps this was the \"communication and understanding\" that the Mistress of Many Waters sought after, thought the water sprite to herself,<br>As she gave him one last smile, covering the sunlike blaze, leaving only rainbow hues in the rising vapor.<br><br>...<br><br>The ancient scrolls of the Meztli tell a completely different story, however—<br>Under the gentle moonlight, the hero Uenuku met the wandering water sprite and fell in love.<br>Yet, in a moment of suspicion, he was separated from his beloved, whose name was Hineila (or Ianeira).<br>\"They say that the human heart is as capricious as the tides. Yet how easy it is to conquer the tides; how difficult the human heart.\"<br>Filled with regret, the hero Uenuku wandered every inch of the scorched lands, searching only for his beloved.<br>After decades of relentless pursuit, the water sprite's hardened heart softened, finally showing a trace of compassion.<br>She plucked a soft cloud from the sky and turned it into a rainbow, guiding the hero towards the sea's other side.<br>Blessed by the Sacred Flame, Uenuku and his lover were finally reunited, never to be separated again.<br>The tribal elders believe that the shells we see today are fragments of the rainbow that fell into the sea back then,<br>And that the reason they are always formed with two connected sides is because they symbolize our wish for reunion."
