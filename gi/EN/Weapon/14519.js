By the time the calamity finally waned, the withering tide had permeated her very bones.<br>As the last shadow crumbled with a scream, the aged Fietena removed her mask,<br>And this prop, with which she had played the \"hero\" for many years, she handed to Taika, a young follower from the Flower-Feather Clan.<br><br>\"It seems this was my final battle... Come now, no need to look so grim.\"<br>\"When the storm passes, a rainbow will shine; but remember, its false colors are but illusions in the mist.\"<br>\"Whether truly a hero or just acting the part, there will always come a day when it's your turn to bow out.\"<br>\"That is the way of the wrestler. But now, Taika, let this mask bear witness to the journey before you.\""
