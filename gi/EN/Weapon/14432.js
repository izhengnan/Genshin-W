        "<br>Beyond the ruins of the ancient palace and on the edge of the wasteland stands the tranquil sacred forest of Lake Amsvartnir.<br>Legend has it that whoever breaks the golden branch in the forest will find the royal court of the Seelie, which is concealed from mortal eyes during the day.<br>A kingdom of the past, it lies forgotten by both time and space, hidden in shadow where no heavenly light can touch it.<br>Its owner has long departed, leaving behind nothing but a neglected courtyard and a hall stripped bare.<br>Yet, within the palace that should have been abandoned, a young woman's silent lament echoes across its walls.<br>\"Once upon a time, the titan craftsman of the skies once wove the destinies of all living beings, the golden harp their instrument of fate.\"<br>\"That was the divine plan of the heavens. If it were followed, the entire world would usher happiness in.\"<br>\"Yet even the ignorant can dream, and in her dream, a new future revealed itself.\"<br>\"She saw men raise a tower to the heavens, and from its heights, the tower's apostle waging war against the sky...\"<br>\"She saw roaring beasts, each larger than a mountain, breaking free from the bonds of the earth...\"<br>\"She saw three moons casting their light upon the sea, a sight soon eclipsed by an ancient dragon rising like a tide.\"<br>\"All that vanished the moment she awoke, as if it had never happened.\"<br>\"All that remained was the indescribable glance from those star-like eyes.\"<br>\"Was that love? Perhaps it was just delusion woven from hope, ambition, and a longing for death.\"<br>\"But that matters not now, for their story has ended, and it became Elysium's finale.\"<br>\"The chirping of insects on a long-gone autumn night is the chorus of exiles, singing mankind's most ancient song as they live out their plight...\"<br>\"They had lost the place of their bodies and souls, with nothing left but songs and memories of the homeland they once knew.\"<br>The last singers, the first Seelie, they played their final tune in the hall of angels.<br>The wolf who once broke into this place had long since departed. Only unfulfilled dreams remain, and continue to chase phantoms."
