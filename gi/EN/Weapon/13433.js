        "<br>How many rains must fall upon a seed before it bears fruit?<br>How many choices must one make in life to find the way to happiness?<br>There are things even the gods may not know. Yet, mortals must struggle to learn them, even if it should cost them their entire lives.<br>Such a choice lay before Soini, the son of a poor farmer, and he could not help but tighten his grip on the shovel in his hand.<br><br>A secret treasure had been unearthed from the tired, hollowed-out soil. If he could sell it on the black market, he might be able to escape a life of poverty.<br>A ragged man with treasure in his hands was bound to draw greedy eyes. And with the brutal winter closing in, he had no choice but to take a precarious step.<br>First purchasing a Fatui uniform, the clever peasant then closed his first deal, using the disguise to intimidate any threats who might lurk.<br>Soini was reveling in success when a dark shadow surged out at the end of the road — the very same thief who had sold him his uniform.<br>\"Hand over the treasure, or this barren patch will be your tomb!\" Forced under the blade, the peasant complied.<br>The two came to the field where the treasure lay hidden. The thief's gaze fell on a jagged piece of black spine bone, and a sudden, wild thrill ignited within him.<br>\"Surely these are the remains of the master thief,\" he said, lifting the bone with trembling hands. He was unaware that in this moment, he had sealed his own fate.<br>With a heavy thud, a farming shovel drove the thief into the earth. In that moment, Soini knew he had to leave the farm for good.<br><br>The now-bloodied treasure had opened a perilous path to the very summit of the black market, a path Soini marched grimly through.<br>He came to be named \"Godfather\" by the desperate criminals who flock here, lured by the charnel scent of fortune.<br>\"Oh most esteemed Godfather, your wisdom is the light we follow. The black market is honored to count you as one of our own!\"<br>Yet, no one really knows why a worn-out shovel, of all things, rests above the Godfather's throne.<br><br>In those blood-soaked times, he kept the shovel as a constant reminder that for a robber, death was always a hair's breadth away.<br>Now, countless treasures lie buried admist the border reefs. Each one is a potential chip, to be traded for loyalty and terror.<br>He no longer wastes time agonizing over choices, for his power and wealth can correct any misstep.<br>The world is governed by a hidden law, an unstoppable cycle in which the rich grow richer and the poor sink ever deeper into hardship.<br>The Godfather was no wiser in mind than the poor peasant he once was, and no different in deed from the thief who once tried to kill him.<br>\"Then why? Why was it I who claimed the treasure my shovel unearthed, and another whom the shovel buried?\"<br>Was it all nothing more than chance? Did luck simply favor him more than the thief who met his end that day?<br>A thousand choices and a lifetime of sacrifice, all made in pursuit of happiness. Yet in the end, it had all come down to chance!<br><br>A wave of disgust washed over Soini at the sheer injustice of it all. \"This is where all my treasures are,\" he uttered.<br>Thus did he reveal his treasure map to the public. Anyone in the borderlands could now vie for the prize, armed with nothing but their own capabilities.<br>Let them succeed or fail. Soini cared not how their stories would end either way.<br>The Godfather, draped in finery yet still gripping a shovel, had come to understand the kind of justice Reed Miller preached:<br><br>\"If the laws of this world are destined to be unbalanced, let gold find its way to gold, and let earth return to earth.\"<br>\"This world needs a hand to balance the scales — let that hand belong to the thief.\""
