With it, you shall repel every demon.\"<br><br>So the doctor took up that devilishly red staff, igniting all that was impure.<br>Those who have passed, unable to bear deep sadness, but who have since become shrouded by ill karma and calamity,<br>They shall be reduced to ashen butterflies in this flame, and receive relief from their misfortunes and hurts.<br>As for the doctor who lit those countless flames, legend has it that they, too, were reduced to smoke in the shape of a lovely butterfly.<br><br>Though these rites have been forgotten over time and with the coming of peace,<br>Those with fire in their hearts can still hear these whispered words from flickering flames when they find themselves faced with an imposing darkness:<br>\"Only an unbound flame can purify this world.\"<br>"
