We're sure to uncover some rich vein of ore or trove of treasure!\"<br>\"Indeed, Kau Kau, and when we do, our deeds will be recorded on woven scrolls.\"<br>Once upon a time, these two youths from the People of the Springs had sworn to explore all of Natlan.<br>To them, adventures and victories were a duty bestowed by the Wayob,<br>While stories of mysterious islands and heroes of yore filled their hearts and minds.<br>And so the young adventurers set out on their journey to perform a pilgrimage on foot.<br><br>But legends of bygone heroes seldom record the troubles that afflict ordinary people,<br>And the world contains far fewer treasures than it does intrepid explorers.<br>The ore they dug up was mostly ordinary, the crystals they uncovered, humdrum even amongst mundanities.<br>But what of it? Their joy remained undimmed, and by the light of their nighttime bonfires, they held up the rocks they had collected.<br>They recalled the scenes and the sentiments they had experienced when they found them.<br>This one was taken from beneath the claws of a giant Tepetlisaurus while they were passing through crystal-filled mountains.<br>While this one was the vicious fiend that tripped them by the edge of a natural hot spring when they were drunk.<br>This stone, covered in ashes, had once stood lengthy vigil on the edge of an ancient city, burned to ash.<br>There it had remained until the two travelers passed by and took it for themselves, paying no mind to the gray sentinel's wishes.<br><br>And now, as the forger of stone takes each one and melts it down, the past stirs once more — brought back to life with each memory spoken.<br>When they learned that Akamai's descendant wished to emulate their forebear, they chose to use these rocks as materials.<br>They would forge a blade to protect the scion soon to travel, for they knew only too well the dangers that lurked within the world.<br>When the great blade was forged, Akamai and Kau Kau handed it to the would-be wanderer as a parting gift.<br><br>\"Let the memories of the past accompany you on your journey, in place of forebears who now lack the strength to...\"<br>\"The past flows through the blood into each new generation, like an unquenchable fire passed down through rituals that never cease to burn.\""
