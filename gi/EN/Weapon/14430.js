        "<br>Once, when the mighty winds blew through the valley where the springs converged, a giant who towered like a mountain once stood by the sea's edge.<br>Within his sandstone-like body, a scorching heart burned, and the steam that rose thereby nigh blocked out the sun.<br>All knew that this was Tupac of the Meztli, and that none who ever lived was taller than he.<br>From the mountains to the seas, from the forests to the plains, not one in Natlan was his equal.<br><br>This was a rare time of prosperity. Peace reigned in the four corners of the earth. Even the ancient shadow-foe was silent.<br>Under the sunlight, people flourished and were at ease, almost forgetting the ancient, traditional night patrols.<br>Yet, though all the tribes recognized his name, and even the rebellious hero was hard-pressed to match him,<br>Still mighty Tupac was sullen, his wild spirit like a dragon trapped in a pool.<br><br>\"I should have been born in the times of yore. Then, I might have stood alongside masterful Xbalanque, cleaving the skulls of wicked dragons from their necks.\"<br>\"Or perhaps I should have been one of those who raised the golden-eyed royal banner, striking at the brutal Python King and saving the people from destruction.\"<br>\"Shall this strength of mine be wasted upon this age of mediocrity?\"<br><br>The waves lapped against his feet, the flocks of gulls circled the reefs, and the sea breeze began to sing.<br>Since he had no equals on land, the only thing to do now was to look to the untouched seas beyond.<br>If he could bring back the great bones of some titanic beast, or discover some treasures from times bygone, he might not have lived in vain.<br>And so he stepped into the sea's wrathful churn, and let the endless currents carry him to parts unknown.<br><br>First, he encountered a winged dragon once exiled by a wise king of old, and its wings served as sails to catch the wind.<br>Next came the whale that once drove the waves themselves backward. Its bones the giant used as his white boat.<br>Then came the voracious sea python of the depths, whose fang became Tupac's trusty weapon.<br>After turning that great seabed-dwelling serpent into a delicious meal to go with his drink, he at last reached the edge of the sea.<br><br>\"Tupac, hero of the blazing lands, valiant titan, rest your arrogant waves here.\"<br>\"You are sullen, for the deathly path is yet hidden, and the dark gate has not revealed itself to you.\"<br>\"Hone your flesh and blood, that they may be as iron armor. Temper your muscle and bone, that they may be as a golden mace.\"<br>\"Lose not your true heart, and forget not your oath, until the day the exile, who was once your foe, returns.\"<br><br>When the final moment came, mighty Tupac finally understood his duty.<br>Carrying the master of flames, he came to the place where fire belonged, the Lord of the Night's admonishment still ringing in his ears.<br>Forever etched into the earth would his legend be, no less than those of any other ancient hero.<br>And thus did he witness death's door showing itself to him, just as he had once sworn to the deity."
