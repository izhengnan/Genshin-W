        "<br>Once upon a time, whispered tales spoke of a bloodthirsty spirit amidst the cold forest veiled in frost and mist.<br>Legend told of a malevolent phantom, swift to anger, that spared no one who trespassed the deepwood's bower.<br>Whether they be the overbearing soldiers of the northern realm, or the most raucous bandits of the tundra,<br>All fell a-quiet at the mention of Nephilheim's desolation. They would instinctively lower their voices,<br>As if fearing that the low hum behind them might be the last sound they would ever hear.<br><br>Very few knew that the hum came not from some vile spirit, but from the keen edge of a blade wielded by an unknown hunter.<br>The silent hunter was an exile, one whose name appeared in no records and who had never fought for any ideal or banner.<br>But for the children who had lost their homes in those turbulent times and fled to the frigid forest,<br>Clutching a conch as their only token of trust, he simply killed every villain that appeared in those woods.<br>The cold metal of the blade could never mimic the echo of the conch, just like how the past could never be reclaimed.<br>Yet the warmth that bloomed from people's necks was enough to silence the wicked, preserving the children's peaceful dreams.<br><br>From the days of the gentry and the old Tsar, and through the protracted struggle to reconstruct a new order,<br>The wandering hunter stayed silent, his only constant the whistle that hunted in the cold nights.<br>It was only when the frozen woods were emptied of all the children who had lost a place of refuge,<br>And the aged guardian himself had forgotten how to speak amidst the endless pale nights,<br>Did the hunter finally cast his blade aside. He then turned toward the deepwood and vanished, never to be seen again."
