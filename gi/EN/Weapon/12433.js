You may have it, my dear, just as you have claimed the mantle of that master thief...\"<br>\"But do remember: I was the first to break this mechanism. Let my name be etched into your heart, a name you will remember forever, alongside your failure.\"<br><br>The Grand Duke's dinner banquet had been a blatant provocation to thieves everywhere, for the secret treasure on display was impossible to steal, or so he boasted.<br>The young lady, scoffing at the arrogance, vowed to make away with his treasure in what would be one last heist before her retirement.<br>But someone had beaten her to the punch. The thief, who went by the \"Escape Artist,\" had left a taunting message on the wall, and its sting left her seething with fury — as well as humiliation.<br><br>What followed were countless grudging contests, each one ending in a humbling defeat.<br>The lockpicking skills the young woman once prided herself were found constantly wanting in her rivalry with this unseen nemesis.<br>The more she failed, the more her shame burned, and the more she hungered to meet the one who kept beating her.<br>This went on until one day, the infuriating rival who always left her red with rage vanished without a trace.<br>Subsequently, word reached her that this thief had been caught and executed.<br><br>For reasons she could not explain, she found herself at the rambling graves, unearthing the stone coffin containing the prisoner's body.<br>But when she dug it up and looked inside, she found that the body was gone. All that remained was a mocking sentence, etched in the cold stone.<br><br>Wiping away tears she couldn't quite explain, the young woman cursed her longtime foe's cunning through clenched teeth.<br>As always, she swore to dedicate her life to uncovering the truth behind his faked death and, once and for all, outwitting him.<br>In the end, time claimed both the beauty she once flaunted and the final breath she held.<br>Bereft of the strength to pick even a simple lock, the woman cursed his name one last time before resting inside the empty coffin."
