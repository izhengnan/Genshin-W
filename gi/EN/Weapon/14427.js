        "<br>Often do I hear people sing, hear them tell tales,<br>At this joyous banquet, when they gather together.<br>My heart spurs me on to recite a new song for you:<br>I shall strum my strings, weave my melody,<br>Start my song, begin my tale,<br>Of an ancient ancestor, the valiant giant Tupac.<br>...<br>The young, heroic Tenoch would be enraged to hear this,<br>Like a fierce gator, a prideful stag.<br>He would have raised his stick high and said to Tupac:<br>Why did you come out to sea? Why did you cross the waves?<br>Your ancestor Uenuku would not have been so audacious.<br>If you dare oppose me, I shall make sure you end up as fish food!<br><br>Tupac, built like a mountain, would have laughed upon hearing this,<br>Like a fierce rhino, a majestic emu.<br>Grasping his drinking horn tightly, he would have replied:<br>How could a weakling like you harm me in the slightest?<br>By right, this drinking horn belongs to me, to the kin of my homeland.<br>If you dare to seize it from me, come wrestle me first!<br><br>Tupac, built like a mountain, had always been a heroic figure:<br>Once, in a fit of rage, he had broken mountains with his bare hands,<br>Thrust rocks into the earth to make hot springs bubble up.<br>(The hot springs that can now be seen in the southwest,<br>Are his legacy, still visible to this day.)<br>Alone he once set out to sea to battle a giant two-tailed whale,<br>Tore off the fierce beast's teeth to carry with him.<br>Like the springs of that era, his heart was fervent and untamed,<br>How could the young, heroic Tenoch possibly hope to impress him?<br>...<br>Tupac, built like a mountain, recalled the events of decades past,<br>When he contended with Tenoch for the drinking horn.<br>And so he spoke before the lord of the blazing flames,<br>Tupac, built like a mountain, would offer up the drinking horn.<br>He would present it, revealing his final hope,<br>Revealing his final hope, thus holding the flame high,<br>Thus holding the flame high, even till his final breath,<br>Even till his final breath, he had not betrayed his oath.<br>...<br>This is where my story ends; may the youth remember well,<br>Remember the words I spoke, the legends of the ancients.<br>My father once sang, in a golden sea breeze,<br>My mother taught me too, when I was young and naive.<br>The years of darkness have long passed, the calamities subsided.<br>There is always singing above the flowing springs; always feasts when dusk begins to fall.<br>But let the new generation remember, lest they forget this warning:<br>Above all else, there are two things that must never be forsaken — unity and promises."
