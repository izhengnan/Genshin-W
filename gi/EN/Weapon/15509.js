        "<br>This bow, crackling with thunder, retains its luster despite having been soaked in thick darkness.<br>When disaster came from a distant sea, it was once the favorite weapon of a great swordsman.<br><br>In his youth, he wandered the mountains, and he made a wager with a great Tengu he came across.<br>He gambled his young, strong body as a bet against a bow given by the Shogun.<br><br>As for the gamble itself, he could only sometimes recall it, when he was drunk.<br>But by the time dawn came, he had three wins and three losses — his contest with the Tengu was a draw.<br>So in the bad news, he was taken as a servant by the Tengu. But in the good news, he won that unmatched bow.<br><br>\"Behold, Konbumaru, this is Tengu archery. Watch and learn!\"<br>He was given this rather ridiculous nickname, but ultimately, he witnessed the Tengu's form.<br>Soaring through the clouds unfettered, unleashing thunderbolts with every bowstring's pulse...<br>It was a true, unreserved dance of death. Fierce and unpredictable, elegant and beautiful.<br><br>Many years later, he was no longer a servant boy, and he had grasped both some archery and swordsmanship.<br>He was referred to the Shogunate through a recommendation letter from his impatient master.<br>In the years under the Shogun, his martial skills improved greatly, and he made many friends and enemies.<br>Still, his hobby of unrestrained wanderlust had not changed. On the contrary, with the Tengu's great bow, he became yet more fearless.<br><br>\"Let's make a wager this time, shall we? Hmm. Right, then. This bow shall be my wager.\"<br>\"I bet on the mightiest bow in the world that I will return here alive.\"<br>\"I'll leave it here with you for now. If I, Takamine, lose our bet, you can keep the bow.\"<br>\"After all, you've inherited the essence of my archery techniques. You'll be able to make good use of it.\"<br>\"But if I win...\"<br><br>When disaster swept in from across the distant sea, the samurai and the obstinate shrine maiden had a mutual wager.<br>They bet on his safe return from the abyss against the inscribed bow bestowed by the Shogun.<br><br>When the dark venom sank deep into the earth and peace returned, the swordsman did not come back.<br>The Shogun's bestowed bow was given to the shrine maiden as her prize for winning their great wager.<br>Later, in the forest where the Kitsune Saiguu would no longer appear, in the promised meeting place,<br>The lone returnee who came stumbling back from the abyss finally met the shrine maiden again, though by now she could no longer be called young.<br>Dull eyes stained with dried blood and tears regained their radiance, but were pierced through by a barbed arrow glowing with power."
