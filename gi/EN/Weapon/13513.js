        "<br>In the undercity that knows neither rain nor sun, she eked out a miserable existence, and for as little as a slice or two of moldy bread,<br>She would not flinch from pulling out a rusty blade to take the life of someone as insignificant as herself.<br>That the weak and cowardly inevitably become prey for the strong — this is the \"natural order\" that rules the Fleuve Cendre.<br>As such, if some day the hunter should become the hunted, they should accept their fate as prey,<br>Just as her late mother had taught her: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<br><br>Looking back on her life, everything up to this point seemed utterly without meaning, with nothing achieved and nothing to hope for.<br>Yet if this was the \"natural\" way of the world, then coming to accept this was surely a form of happiness in its own right?<br>However, in spite of her expectations, death did not come. Opening one eye nervously, she looked up,<br>To see a girl in strange attire smiling back gently, who then placed a flower — whence it came she knew not — behind her ear.<br><br>\"We call this flower a Lumidouce Bell, which in the language of flowers... means hope. Look, the color matches your hair.\"<br>\"You have such beautiful eyes. It would be such a pity if all they reflected was despair.\"<br>\"Come, little lass with the sapphire eyes, let me trade this flower for your heart.\"<br><br>Thus did Marfisa, who would be later famed as a Champion Duelist, first step into the city above ground.<br>Watching on from the luxury of a VIP box in the magnificent theater, she could no longer remember the smiling faces of the magician and their assistant on stage,<br>Only how, as the fantasy played out, a profusion of flowers blossomed under the dazzling spotlight — bright, pure, and ever so strong.<br>If she could walk in the sunlight as \"naturally\" as her, she would no longer need to hide in the ashes.<br>Seeing this, she understood that she should yet cherish hope — that this life, having now seen the light, might blossom like Lumidouce.<br><br>In this way, just as she dreamed, the girl born from the ashes finally stepped onto a stage of her own,<br>And with no master passing down techniques but relying only on her own astonishing talent, all the spear-fighting techniques she had ever seen found expression in her performance.<br>There was no mercy under the sharp edge of her lance, only showers of crimson, like a bed of scarlet roses falling for her alone.<br>On stage, hers was a cold and noble figure that seemed to dance with \"death\" itself,<br>Almost like the sapphire witch in Master Coppelius's famous work, who was said to be able to visualize fatal flaws.<br><br>Life and death, victory and defeat, all was the way it should be, and so long as she acted in accordance with logic as she saw it,<br>The path to \"victory\" would open up before her — irrespective of good, evil, and the so-called rules of the overworld.<br>Until one day, finally reaching the end of her unbeaten streak, she was deceived by a swordsman's sly eyes, tricked by a deliberate slowing of the rhythm,<br>Into revealing a fatal flaw of her own, her arm struck by his blade, forcing her to concede that her skill was inferior.<br><br>\"You have an interesting style of fighting, albeit slightly stiff, as if you follow a predetermined path.\"<br>\"But human hearts change, and in this world there is no such thing as a light that burns forever. Being a stickler for the rules is your weakness.\"<br>\"That said, your style seems to rely solely on the 'rules' you so trust in, hence your difficulty in abandoning them.\"<br>\"Perhaps you should consider changing your approach, and making 'that which is immutable' your 'rule' instead?\"<br>\"For instance, take 'justice.' As the Golden Hunter put it, even should the sky fall and the earth be rent asunder, there would still be justice in the world.\"<br><br>\"What right do you surface dwellers have to speak of justice? Your skills may be slightly superior to mine, yet you need not lecture me so, all high and mighty.\"<br>\"Sooner or later, Hunter, there will come a day when you too will fall before my lance.\"<br><br>Despite her reply, perhaps the man was right — crimes should be punished and lies exposed.<br>This is how the world should be, justice prevailing over all. Otherwise, how could he have defeated her?<br>As it was so, it made sense for her to be guided by justice, and offer up a cold elegy to those who would seek to evade judgment.<br>And so, the girl born from the ashes abandoned her original set of rules, becoming a purple-clad enforcer instead,<br>Upholding justice \"as it ought to be,\" until the fire of Poisson brought the criminal Parsifal before her...<br><br>...<br>Looking back on her life, everything up to this point seemed utterly without meaning, with nothing achieved and nothing to hope for.<br>Yet if this was the \"natural\" way of the world, then coming to accept this was surely a form of happiness in its own right?<br>But despite this, when she fell into those pure sourcewaters, all that had previously seemed self-evident lost its meaning.<br>Up to the moment her memories dissolved in the water, she never knew that the Lumidouce Bell's true meaning in the language of flowers was never hope,<br>Just as her late mother had taught her: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,<br>And at the end of that long pursuit, even fate did not offer her the blossoming elegy that it ought to have."
