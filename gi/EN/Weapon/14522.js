At the end of all three ways lay the Night of Oblivion.<br>That was the future once lamented by the vanished moons, in the era when three were still three.<br><br>But, in the dark night, were there truly only three paths that they saw?<br>In the memories that belonged to her alone, a golden star not of this world<br>Was reflected in the cold, lonely courtyard under the silver moon — that strand of starlight always lingered in her heart...<br>Linger it did, even across millions of years, even across countless worlds long extinguished.<br>That star, once captured in her gaze, would surely illuminate her journey home...<br><br>In the next timeless instant of such unwavering belief, begins the era when three are no longer three.<br>At the edge of darkness, the Lord of the Crossroads looked back at the fourth path beyond the three-way fork,<br>Amid honeyed veils of dreamy hues, she tarried silently, waiting for the appointed meeting with her companions beneath the stars.<br><br>\"O little dove, child of the moon,\"<br>\"Let not sorrow for hardship or parting weigh upon your heart,\"<br>\"The flowers will bloom once more by your window,\"<br>\"And the moon will be with you in your slumber by night or day.\""
