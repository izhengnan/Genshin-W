                "Content": "Ganyu is not the secretary of any one leader in the Liyue Qixing but is instead the general secretary for the entire organization. Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary. Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question. \"What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished.\"",

Under pressure, her nervousness does result in the occasional error.<br>One such incident occurred during the Rite of Descension, without doubt the most important annual event in Liyue's calendar.<br>Ganyu was three minutes late for the Rite and had to squeeze through the crowd in full view of all.<br>Later on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart.<br>Her colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake.<br>Those who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.<br>Those closer to her worried in private, and asked if she needed a workload adjustment or a short vacation, but Ganyu refused.<br>\"I spent two hours making sure that I wasn't wearing anything too similar to last year's Rite...\"<br>Needless to say, Ganyu was not about to admit to this being the real reason for her tardiness!",

Even the raucous dancing of hilichurls will fail to wake her.<br>These habits were at first just a running joke within the Liyue Qixing.<br>But once, after accompanying the then-Tianxuan to lunch outside the city, a well-fed Ganyu simply crawled into the nearest roadside haystack. She ended up being transported all the way to Dihua Marsh, awakening only after bumping her head during the unloading.<br>Unable to find Ganyu anywhere over the subsequent three hours, and knowing that she would not depart unannounced, the Tianxuan almost filed a missing person report.<br>After receiving a stern admonishment to \"only take afternoon naps where it's safe,\" Ganyu retorted:<br>\"Well... isn't everywhere in Liyue safe?\"<br>Perhaps, with the mixture of human and illuminated beast blood flowing through her veins, Ganyu's understanding of the world's affairs is a little different to that of most humans.",

For Ganyu, the difficulty of such a challenge is second only to finding a Flaming Flower atop Dragonspine.<br>But she is not one to give up half-way through the ascent.<br>During the Archon War, she once choked a giant monster to death with ease after getting lodged in its throat when it tried to eat her, said monster having fatally underestimated quite how wide her waistline was.<br>For Ganyu, avoiding any similarly embarrassing episodes in the future is an absolute must.",

They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved — a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a better polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a Vision appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans. Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty.",

Naturally, she has little mind to spare for matters of personal dress, to say nothing of accessories or makeup.<br>Over time, her everyday appearance and the word \"busy\" have become tightly bound. Even when she is spotted on her brief days off, one cannot help but worriedly picture her doing overtime till she practically falls asleep standing up, or wonder if she might suddenly do an about-face and make a beeline to take care of the nearest article of urgent business.<br>Xianyun saw all this, of course, and had long been considering countermeasures. Just as well, then, that Lantern Rite was imminent, and a suggestion that she had heard on the streets came to mind:<br>\"A change of clothes may make for a change of mood...\"<br>Thus did the adeptus retrieve a machine she had sealed in storage for many years. Using it, some of her friend Ping's best Silk Flowers, and the dyes made using divine herbs from her abode, she weaved several bolts of fabric and satin of immaculate quality and color. As for the exquisite hair ornaments and pendants, they were made of the same material as her adeptal machines. Elegant, lovely, and infused with faint fragrance.<br>Then, Xianyun brought the fabric and satin to one of the finest tailors in Liyue Harbor, though she did give the poor artisan quite a fright — after all, any ordinary valuation would appraise these materials at a price point somewhere around \"couldn't get more expensive if you'd just melted Mora down and spun it into silk.\"<br>Xianyun was pleased indeed with that reaction.<br>\"One's disciple has worked many years at Yuehai Pavilion — a figure of standing and repute, surely, and more than worthy of such finery!\"<br>Of course, Xianyun did not mention the unique aspects of the fabric or the accessories when she gave Ganyu this gift, mentioning only that the tailor's craftmanship had satisfied her.<br>Nonetheless, Ganyu could intuit the value of the raiment and the thought her master put into its impeccable artisanry from how the garment seemed to flow like water in her hands.<br>And so she changed out of her usual working clothes and came out, light of heart, to meet the adeptus and her gathered friends, and at that moment her mood did quietly change—<br>As the clear starry night sky, as a tranquil scene of fragrant blossoms.<br>\"Putting duty aside to spend a carefree Lantern Rite with everyone... This, too, is an experience precious beyond measure.\""
