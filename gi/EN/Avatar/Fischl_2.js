Not everyone gets to be the Prinzessin der Verurteilung's familiar, do you understand? Consider it your honor to dedicate your life to serving me!\"<br>Fischl is able to see through Oz's eyes. Whenever she wants to, she possesses Oz and looks down upon the earth from the sky.<br>Whether she wants to inspect the flora on the Stormbearer Mountains or observe a disturbance in Wolvendom, through Oz she can see anything and everything.<br>Thanks largely to her unique ability — and, to a lesser extent, to her own effort and peculiar personality — Fischl quickly went from the rookie investigator of the Adventurers' Guild to a respected rising star of the organization.<br>She's certainly done well for herself. She only landed the coveted position of Investigator at age fourteen in the first place because her parents managed to persuade the guild master.<br>Then again, would they really have had to do much persuading? If she's the Prinzessin der Verurteilung... one can only assume that would make them the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung.",

You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.'\"<br>\"Oh, that's a lovely story. Since you like it so much, ███, how about I call you \"Fischl\" too?\" Her father smiled, put his hand on her head and repeated the words from the story to her.<br>\"Fischl, you are my wonderful princess and my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.\"<br>These kind and loving words lit up her world.<br>However, the time with her busy parents was always fleeting.<br>Unable to fit in with her peers due to her obsession with fantasy novels, she often felt lonely and sad. At these times, she would remind herself:<br>\"I am Fischl, my daddy's wonderful princess. It's true, because Mommy and Daddy said so...\"<br>\"Never will I surrender my nobility and dreams, for they are... a princess' rite of passage.\"",

My parents will understand,\" she thought to herself.<br>For if she knew one thing, it was that as a princess she could never surrender her nobility and dreams.<br>But when she threw herself into her parents' arms in need of comfort, she was met instead with gentle words of exasperation.<br>\"███, you are fourteen years old now. It's fun to make-believe, but eventually you need to grow up and put your childish dreams behind you...\"<br>And with that, the same voice that had once lit up her world now tore it apart.<br>That day at midnight, she hid herself in the library she knew so well. She had a strange feeling that she was being watched... Suddenly, she heard an otherworldly flapping of wings.<br>Sure enough, she looked up and her red, swollen eyes met with those of a night raven from another world.<br>What transpired afterwards is another story...<br>Fischl doesn't much like this story.

But that would be ███'s story, not Fischl's.<br>Fischl has but one identity: she's the Prinzessin.<br>As long as she remembers this simple and perfect logic, with a little bit of nobility and a touch of kindness from others, nothing can ever hurt her.<br>Things are looking up for Prinzessin Fischl these days — not only does she have Oz, but she has finally met a traveler who, just like her, comes from a different world...",

Just a little twist of fate, nothing more.<br>The Prinzessin will come to understand someday that each moment of her life, no matter how insignificant their little twists could be, is to be treasured.<br>After all, the Prinzessin's very own Phantasmagoria is made out of ones such as these.",
