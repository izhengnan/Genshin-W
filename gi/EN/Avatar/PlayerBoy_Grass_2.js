You'd think someone would be making a killing off of that out here.<br><color=#37FFFF>Traveler:</color> Maybe Mondstadt wine isn't really designed for exporting. Most of it's brewed and enjoyed locally. It might lose its flavor when transported long distances.<br><color=#37FFFF>Traveler:</color> And even if someone managed to solve that problem, the cost of shipping it all this way would mean they'd have to increase the price, which would make it harder to sell...

This merchant was said to be extremely wealthy and a big spender — meaning he'd brought a huge stash of valuables and Mora with him. And so, the thief and the conman decided to team up to try and steal the merchant's wealth.<br><color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> Uh-oh. How far did they get?<br><color=#37FFFF>Traveler:</color> After working to gain the merchant's trust, the conman invited the merchant out to a big dinner party one evening. The plan was to get him away from his shop for long enough for the thief to break in and steal all the treasure... And it went off without a hitch.<br><color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> ...Aw, poor merchant.<br><color=#37FFFF>Traveler:</color> But the story doesn't end there. The con artist wanted all the loot for himself. He turned on the thief, threatened him into handing everything over, and then sold him out. The thief took the fall and wound up in jail.<br><color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> Huh. Behind every crook is an even crooked-er crook. So in the end, the conman conned both the merchant and the thief... and by the sounds of it, he got away with it too? Ugh...<br><color=#37FFFF>Traveler:</color> Now, your typical crime story would probably end there. But not this one...<br><color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> There's more?<br><color=#37FFFF>Traveler:</color> After the conman finally got his hands on the treasure, he discovered that it was all fake! He started to panic... and then, the merchant comes bursting through the door, demanding that his assets be returned.<br><color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> Wait, but they were fake, right? Why did he want them back?<br><color=#37FFFF>Traveler:</color> Obviously, the merchant claimed that everything stolen by the thief was real. So in the end, the conman was forced to return genuine treasure, and not the fake stuff.<br><color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> Ohh... So the merchant was the real conman in that story! Heh, so much for \"poor merchant.\"<br><color=#37FFFF>Traveler:</color> True, but if the conman and the thief hadn't given in to their crooked ways, the merchant would never have done anything to them. So the moral of this story is:<br><color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> If you're gonna play the con game, you gotta go big or go home!<br><color=#37FFFF>Traveler:</color> ...Actually, it's \"don't give in to your crooked ways\"...",
