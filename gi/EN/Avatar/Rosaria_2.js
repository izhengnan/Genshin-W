She does not work together with her church colleagues and only rarely shows up to celebratory events in the city.<br>The strange and mysterious Rosaria moves about almost like a wisp of black smoke — blink, and you'll miss her as she disappears into thin air.<br>Her social interactions are never more than superficial, and the rest of the time she keeps herself to herself.<br>However, Sister Victoria would say that the ever good-natured Barbara is one person who has always made the effort to get close to Rosaria.<br>\"Please don't smoke in the Cathedral...\" \"Could you try to attend the ceremony on time next time...?\"<br>\"And... Hey, come back, I'm still talking to you!\"<br>Barbara is forever anxiously chasing after Rosaria, urging her to complete her various daily tasks.<br>Yet even when faced with Barbara, the beloved idol of Mondstadt, Rosaria remains completely unmoved.<br>Surely her heart can't be completely made of stone?",

Sometimes, if she makes it back by the crack of dawn, she gets to usher in the day ahead with a glass of breakfast wine.<br>The people of Mondstadt live in the golden sunlight, but Rosaria dwells under the silver moonlight.<br>It is a cold, piercing light... just like that of the ice she forms with her Cryo abilities.<br>\"There are some things that young people need not know,\" Rosaria thinks.<br>Though, in her eyes, \"young people\" means all citizens of Mondstadt who live in the light of the sun, regardless of their age.",

Why does she stay silent while others praise the gods for their protection?<br>Perhaps it should come as no surprise that Rosaria was not born and bred in Mondstadt.<br>\"A city that is fortunate enough to be boring always needs someone to do the dirty work...\"<br>Rosaria stubs her cigarette out as she speaks in her characteristically languid manner.<br>\"And as far as I'm concerned, the things I deal with are far simpler than living the life of a traditional sister.\"",

As their youngest member, Rosaria was judged to have a chance of rehabilitation.<br>Grand Master Varka brought her to Mondstadt. Sincerely hoping that she might someday fit in here, he advised her:<br>\"Go to the Cathedral and be cleansed by the light of our archon. You still have the chance to turn your fate around and live a normal life.\"<br>But Varka had not counted on Rosaria constantly skipping classes and dodging hymnal.<br>She would rather hunt in the wild than settle into a life of dutiful service as a sister. As far as she was concerned, the golden sunlight was not so much cleansing as blinding.<br>For Rosaria had long since come to understand that she was a child of the moonlight, and it was inevitable that she would someday return to the embrace of darkness.",

Rosaria's theological essay is an utter mess!\"<br>\"Miss Rosaria, if I may ask frankly... do you intend to do any work at all here at the Church?\"<br>\"No. I've already found other work.\"<br>Rosaria never showed so much as a hint of anxiety in any of these exchanges. What's more, it was true — she had indeed found other work for herself, and much darker work at that.<br>The unexpected twist was that she would ultimately end up doing this work under the aegis of the Church.<br>Rosaria the novice did not leave the clergy, but instead became Sister Rosaria without much incident.<br>Nevertheless, when she's not on a mission, she does everything she can to avoid attending church activities, instead heading to the taverns to drink or scaling the city walls to view the scenery.<br>And when she simply cannot escape a church engagement, you can be sure that she will be the first to leave.<br>The instant the workday is done, Rosaria vanishes.<br>Whether by bright day or dark night, there is one principle that she will never transgress: no overtime.",

Kill me, and you can leave this place. I'm long in the tooth now, while you've got youth on your side. You can do this, can't ya?\"<br>No one thought that she would be able to kill him — and yet, the old lion would indeed fall by the newborn cub's claws.<br>Thus did the bandits lose an old member and welcome a new one that very night.<br>The bandits were reluctant to accept Rosaria at first since she had slain one of their own, but they quickly had a change of heart after seeing the Vision in her hand.<br>Surely, a Vision wielder had to be far stronger than some old coot who was about to kick the bucket right? And she ate less, to boot... They could save some food this way.<br>Meanwhile, a question crept into Rosaria's frozen heart:<br>Did he let me replace him on purpose? ...Could a false father have harbored genuine affection for a child he stole so arbitrarily?",
