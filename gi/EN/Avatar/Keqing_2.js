But for someone in such proximity to a god, Keqing seems to lack the requisite respect the most.<br>\"Hmph. Let's be real here, but does Morax really know everything?\"<br>The Liyue Qixing deal with the day-to-day happenings in the Harbor, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year.<br>While history has shown that following Morax's lead has been the right call, Keqing believes that humans should have their pride and that their views deserve equal consideration.<br>As such, she often advocates different opinions from Rex Lapis, and is the first to put such views into practice.<br>Her radical actions have seen stellar results, but they have also attracted murmurings of opprobrium among those devoted to Rex Lapis.<br>As Keqing sees it, such opposition are the excuses of those who have grown complacent under the aegis of their deity, and who cannot consider the future of humanity of their own accord.<br>But someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and create a new path with their own hands — and the Yuheng star is determined to do her part in this endeavor.",

                "Content": "Keqing is the daughter of an illustrious Liyue family with a proud lineage, and she is better acquainted than most with the influence that Rex Lapis has over the people of Liyue.<br>Once every few years, in an almost cyclical fashion, a major reshuffle hits Liyue's economy after the Rite of Descension. Once Rex Lapis' new policies are announced, some families celebrate while others grieve.<br>The poor hope it will offer them the chance to finally make their fortunes while the wealthy pray that theirs will not be swept away in the changing tides. Rather than carefully analyzing the economic climate, merchants are more prone to making investments based on belief.<br>And in present-day Liyue, this is a forgivable strategy: Rex Lapis is a powerful deity and he can be relied on for all things.<br>But Keqing has her reservations about all this: What if, one day, Rex Lapis stops fulfilling his duty? Then what would become of the people of Liyue?<br>Liyue's present prosperity is akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach — humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.<br>However, Keqing has been unable to garner majority support for her views. From most people's perspective, life is but a brief, insignificant moment in Liyue's long history, and there is no point in working oneself up into an existential quandary.<br>This perspective, as far as Keqing is concerned, is a lazy and cowardly one that denies there is any value at all in the existence of the human race. \"If humans really have no value,\" Keqing retorts, \"then why should we expect the gods to care about us so much?\"<br>Unwilling to compromise on her beliefs, she cast her skepticism on everything — everything from Rex Lapis' loving-kindness, to the people's laziness, to the way that society runs.<br>Issues affecting humans' fate should be handled by humans, and humans are more than capable of handling them with finesse.<br>Finally, the day came of her now-famous speech at the Rite of Descension.<br>\"Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?\"<br>On hearing these words, Rex Lapis burst into hearty laughter. But as for what exactly he was laughing about, only Rex Lapis himself knows.",

                "Content": "Some may be able to keep up with Keqing's forward-thinking ideas, but none can keep up with her pace of work.<br>Perhaps in an effort to become a role model for her people, she demands of herself to work ten times harder than the average person, and she cannot abide any measure of laziness or inefficiency.<br>Humans' abilities and lifespans are more limited than the gods'. This means that one has no hope of living to see the day when humans replace the gods as masters of our own universe if one allows apathy and hesitation to slow themselves down.<br>Because of this same mindset, she is never able to synchronize her work rhythm with the people around her.<br>Whatever the task, she does not rest until the job is done, and when something should take half the month to resolve, she will pull out all the stops to try and get it turned around within the next 48 hours.<br>Additionally, Keqing's notion of 'completing' something is far more ambitious than simply getting it 'finished' — she will make sure that every relevant detail is tied up too. To the outside observer, she seems to be both highly efficient and a perfectionist.<br>But not everyone is as self-motivated as Keqing. No assistant she hires ever makes it past the three-month mark.<br>She has received countless remonstrations urging her to be less impatient, but she meets each one with a stern rejection.<br>Still, she has, to some extent, come around to the idea that a high staff turnover is itself a manifestation of inefficiency, and made some concessions accordingly.<br>Today, if you encounter an assistant of Keqing's dealing with some matter three, four, or even five years ahead of time, don't be alarmed, this is completely normal. Keqing gave them a bit of a head start, but she'll be catching up before long.",

But to be able to think and act as swiftly as lightning, one needs a huge amount of experience to draw on.<br>So, if Keqing sees something that needs doing, why, she'll do it herself. For example, she once served for two months as a laborer to better decide how to refine a plan to improve their treatment.<br>It's hard to imagine that this young lady with so much authority vested in her has pulled carts at The Chasm, rammed earth at the south wharf, and waited tables at small diners.<br>In addition to working, she also once took the opportunity to gather evidence with which to report a powerful individual known for his abuses.<br>He was apprehended without any clue as to how he had been exposed, but when he was brought to the interrogation chamber by the Millelith, there he saw a striking young lady dressed in fine robes.<br>\"Hey! Haven't we... haven't we met somewhere before?\"<br>The words felt foolish the moment they rolled off his tongue, even to him.<br>Especially because the Millelith then introduced her as follows: \"This is the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Know your place and keep your distance!\"<br>—Exactly, so what was he thinking!?",

All the duties Rex once fulfilled have been taken up by the Qixing and the Eight Trades.<br>Now that divine rule is a thing of the past, the old strictures left behind can't simply be continued wholesale. But to establish new laws for Liyue, whose history spans several thousand years, is no mean feat.<br>At first, Keqing was incredibly enthusiastic about this task, having long prepared for this day when she might finally show her mettle. But several months in, and she was still stuck on a single task, land infrastructure — and it was driving her up the wall.<br>No matter how hard she struggled, the mountain of tasks was like a quagmire. She was making difference, yes, but not nearly with as much ease as Rex Lapis.<br>\"Why can I only do this much? Why... can't I do it better?\"<br>Of course, she had long understood the wherefores here.<br>Her lack of respect for gods had somehow received their recognition all the same, yes, but that didn't mean that she was ready to simply replace them.<br>But she was still Keqing, resolute and tenacious.<br>From that day on, she shut herself in, studying classics of various kinds to learn all that she needed. Placing herself lowest, she accepted all that she had hitherto not known with open arms.<br>During this period, she gained a certain calm, slowly discarding the \"opprobrium\" she had long held against Rex Lapis.<br>They were both working for the good of Liyue, after all — and two people who love the same thing need not be on opposing sides.<br>She also seemingly came to an understanding concerning the smile Rex Lapis had given her during that Rite of Descension. It was, Keqing now believes, an expression of acknowledgment and expectation.<br>She hasn't lost any of her forceful and decisive manner, no. But sometimes, when she feels lost, she will stop and think: \"What would Rex Lapis do at a moment such as this?\"",

So, after glancing around to make sure that no one was watching, she paid for, picked up, and packed away her prize in one swift single movement.<br>But no sooner had she placed the figurine into her bag and heaved a sigh of relief than one of her friends, silk bundles in tow, tapped her on the shoulder.<br>In the end, all was revealed. Her friends were quite curious: Wasn't Keqing a skeptic among skeptics? Why would she buy one of these?<br>\"For... For introspection, of course! There's nothing wrong with self-reflection, is there?\"<br>So she said, and it would be convincing, too — if Keqing didn't already have an entire shelf dedicated to Rex Lapis self-reflection memorabilia...",

The story behind it is also rather fascinating—<br>Since her first day as the Yuheng, she has never enjoyed its privileges but has instead devoted much private time to her duty. To improve work efficiency, Keqing prefers a dressing style that prioritizes practicality and only keeps a minimum level of embellishment. Therefore, though like a flower she blooms, she used to dress simple.<br>However, working closely with Ganyu and then Ningguang has given Keqing a sort of epiphany—<br>Keqing accepts that she cannot work day and night like the half-adeptal secretary Ganyu. She also knows Ningguang's way well, who often takes a bath after work to withdraw from the moment. By temporarily putting the crazy agenda aside for the next day, Ningguang thus allows herself to fully relax.<br>Keqing understands that to lead the tide of change requires not impatient leaps and bounds but care for one's body and mind. Good maintenance keeps one going smoothly.<br>Ningguang also gave Keqing similar advice:<br>\"You've never donned anything special for festivals, and people are used to your image as it is. But Liyue is different now. If you show up in front of the public in a new look, it will add to the merrymaking and inspire everyone greatly.\"<br>Keqing was aware of that, but she just wanted to transform silently so that she wouldn't worry her colleagues.<br>Her attire for the Lantern Rite would serve as a good start.<br>\"This attire marks the line between my work and life. By striking a balance between the two, I will find a comfortable pace at which I shall lead the way into a new Liyue.\"<br>Having made up her mind, Keqing had Ningguang's personal tailor make her a dress that still keeps luxury to a minimum. With the attire finished, Keqing threw herself back into the preparations for the Lantern Rite.<br>As for how she ended up overworking herself again, accidents like that do happen, occasionally.<br>While conversing with the Traveler again in the Jade Chamber, their caring advice reminded Keqing of the decision she had made not long ago. A faint smile formed on her face.<br>Perhaps this is what they call the tacit understanding between ideal companions, who are always on the same page.<br>She put on the long-readied attire and spoke gently to the Traveler, who looked her way. Having received generous praises, she turned to the blooming fireworks.<br>The light of festive fireworks set her dress aglow like a star in a dark night. The hem of her dress danced at her steps like flowers flowing in a gentle breeze."
