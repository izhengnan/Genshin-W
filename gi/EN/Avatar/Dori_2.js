You can probably buy anything you can think of from Dori. The only question is: Do you have enough Mora to do so?",

You've got the right person. First things first, you'll need a complete set of water-drawing tools... Which, as it happens, I happen to have for sale!\"<br>There is a tale among adventurers in Sumeru.<br>It says that if you are about to embark on a journey into a dangerous place, you'll see a diminutive figure, seemingly having been waiting for you.<br>Be it in the treacherous mountains, arid deserts, grim rainforests, or desolate areas inhabited by monsters, you'll always see her smiling face.<br>Word has it that Dori carries all manner of marvelous items on her person all the time. Her items can help adventurers get through their pressing troubles.<br>—At a \"reasonable\" price, of course.<br>Adventurers who \"have just received Dori's help in their time of need\" at the cost of \"paying a large sum of Mora at once\" often develop conflicted feelings toward her — somewhere in between gratitude and a grudge.<br>For Dori's part, she considerately ignores the conflicted look on their faces, putting the fresh Mora in her almost-bursting purse and bidding them adieu with a contented smile.<br>\"Thank you for your generous purchase.

I don't cancel or reject any orders.\"<br>\"Every Mora that can be earned, will be earned by me. Why? Well, because it's there, of course.\"",

However, she was inspired by the failed attempt, ordering a large custom-made hourglass.<br>That which was in this hourglass was not sand, but shiny Mora.<br>That night, embraced by the music of jingling Mora, Dori slept soundly at last.<br>After that, Dori learned the trick to dealing with insomnia:<br>\"To sleep well, you must first secure peace of mind.\"",

The cost of raising the Sumpter Beasts was covered by the amusement park's revenue in no time.<br>Dori's love for Sumpter Beasts is genuine, and so is her intention to make Mora out of that love.<br>Perhaps the Jinni in Dori's lamp knows this better than everyone else. The spirit was tricked into entering Dori's lamp, but it has never left since.<br>Dori will summon it into combat, but she will also grant its wishes afterwards.<br>Sometimes the Jinni even thinks that the fairy tale might actually have gotten things reversed —<br>For the one who dwells in the lamp is a powerful fighter, while the one holding the lamp is the one who grants wishes.",

She even pays in advance.<br>\"I, Dori, never default on payment.\"<br>\"Also, Ms. Alice has expenses, too.

At this time, their home came to be ringed by a great many strange adults.<br>The strangers explained the elder sister's situation in serious tones and with unfathomable jargon before sighing at the dingy little room.<br>The younger sister had no idea what was happening, but she visited her sister every day, and her sister would always say this to her with a bright smile:<br>\"It's alright. I just need some rest.\"<br>Seeing that smile, the innocent younger sister's eyes filled with expectation. She even began looking forward to playing together like they used to.<br>But one day, she saw her sister gripping her chest while telling a story.<br>Then, when her frail form collapsed onto the bed, the younger sister reached out to catch her, only to find that her body was so very light.<br>...It was almost as if her sister were a feather, a feather that might drift away to some place far, far away.<br>Later on, the younger sister found a crumpled note.<br>It was a doctor's prescription, with a list of herbs that were desperately scarce — the collectors who had such herbs were few and far between.<br>To purchase those herbs would cost more than tens of millions of Mora, an impossible price for a family that was already struggling to make the ends meet.<br>The elder sister always shook her head with a smile to dismiss her family's insistence on following the prescription. Perhaps she herself could only find the courage to glance at that note in the deep hours of the night — and dare to dream that she might \"live.\"<br>Upon finding out about the note, the younger sister put it into her pocket silently and resolved to save her sister.<br>\"I must make a lot of Mora.\"<br>\"With enough Mora, my family will never have to smile at me while swallowing their pain, and I will never have to lose anything due to lacking Mora...\"<br>Perhaps it was at that moment that the gods looked upon her with mercy.<br>But to an \"ambitious\" person like her, getting a Vision was just the start.<br>In the countless days and nights that have followed, she has constantly kept herself calm and clear-headed, telling herself:<br>\"Conviction alone is not enough. I will work hard for what I desire until the end of my days.\"<br>\"There's nothing that Lord Sangemah Bay cannot achieve.\"",
