She does not know when it started, but interacting with people eventually became tiresome to her.<br>Having ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, Kokomi had no choice but to learn many things that she wasn't any good at before, whether it was dealing with people or performing duties that she had little interest in.<br>However, forcing herself to do things she holds little love for is a serious drain on her energy reserves, leaving her feeling quite exhausted.<br>As such, Kokomi set up an \"energy\" system of measurement for herself. When she does things she enjoys, her energy levels will increase, and the reverse is true when she trudges through unenjoyable slogs.<br>When she runs out of this energy, Kokomi will temporarily put her duties as the Divine Priestess aside and resume being an ordinary homebody.<br>Engrossing herself in the close reading of a book on military strategy, walling herself off from the rest of the world — thus does Kokomi reclaim a temporary respite from her busy existence.<br>These moments are of utmost value to her.",

Was this the role of the Divine Priestess speaking? Or was this a product of her own sense of duty? Or perhaps... it was a bit of both?<br>As the Divine Priestess, Kokomi naturally has her own Vision.
