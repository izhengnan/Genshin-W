His wonderful ingenuity always makes people want to buy his merchandise.<br>Mr. Hushang, who sells toys, has very dexterous hands. With them, he fashions the most fascinating little toys, and they are very popular amongst children.<br>And, of course, everyone has long regarded this smart red-haired girl as a family member too.<br>Every time Nilou goes grocery shopping, she always ends up carrying more items than on her purchase list just by making a single trip through the streets, and the weight of the groceries shows exactly how much people like and take care of Nilou.<br>Of course, Nilou also takes care of them in return.<br>Hushang and Farhad may have a quarrel over a bet, about as long as Nilou shows up, the two will surely be reconciled.<br>If Afshin's Sumpter Beasts have stolen someone else's food, Nilou will come forward and help make amends.<br>If you ask Nilou why she is so enthusiastic, she will answer with a smile:<br>\"Because family is supposed to help each other, hehe.\"<br>For Nilou, her mom and dad are her small family, while everyone in the Grand Bazaar is her big family.",

Which one should I eat tonight?<br>I've heard people talk about places outside Sumeru City... the pure white snowy mountain and windmills the size of giants... Should I also consider going out for a trip?<br>Nilou can often find good reasons to go with any of the options she is considering, and so they are like Forest Tree Frogs sitting across from one another with bellies out, not one able to win the others over.<br>But if there was a person who could make a decision at this time and tell her with confidence and calm:<br>\"Why not have half the amount of each and share them with me?\"<br>\"And as for those places you have never been to, I have already set foot there. I can assure you that they are safe.\"<br>...Nilou would dismiss her hesitation in an instant and raise her arms in a dance-like graceful gesture of thanks, before indulging in the joy of having solved a great problem for a long time indeed.",

If you would like to express your love for Nilou's dance, you may write a letter to the Zubayr Theater instead of sending gifts.\"<br>And so it came to pass that like snow flakes dancing and falling in the air, letters filled with the audience members' passionate praise have been sent in batches and droves by the Dusk Birds to the theater's mailbox.<br>During her free time when there are no shows or rehearsals, Nilou will read every letter carefully, share this joy with the other members of the Zubayr Theater, and then carefully preserve these letters.<br>Every word and every expression of recognition and fondness in the letters is worth remembering and appreciating.<br>As Nilou bettered her dancing skills, more and more people came to watch her dance, and in time, the letters have added up to quite the stack indeed.<br>But if someone cracks a joke, saying that Nilou is the most valuable treasure in the Zubayr Theater, she will definitely shake her head with a sweet smile.<br>\"Our most valuable treasure is our audience's love, and it is all carefully stored in one mysterious box.\"",

But still, she practiced diligently each day under the direction of her teacher and planned to continue following in her footsteps.<br>When she finally first took the stage, she quickly became completely immersed in the performance, holding nothing back.<br>She thought of the wind, the moon, the gentle sound of the rose blooming, the feeling of stroking the tail feathers of Dusk Birds, and a myriad of beautiful things that existed in this world.<br>She wanted to display the beauty she perceived in her heart to the entire audience through her dance.<br>Slowly, splashes of water ran together, converging into a lake on the stage. Like a Crystalfly dancing on a lake's surface, Nilou gently fluttered back and forth, and the lake-mirror rippled slightly in time to her steps.<br>Like a water lily, her body swirled in the middle of that lake. Amazed at such pure and flawless beauty, the audience almost forgot to breathe.<br>After the curtain fell, Nilou flopped down on the backstage chair and took deep breaths.<br>Like dewdrops on a lotus leaf, a Hydro Vision had appeared at her waist.<br>Nilou thought then that she had perhaps found the purpose of dance at last — <br>\"To become beauty, and then to convey the beauty and value of art.\"",

As the music floated through the air, strange feelings awakened joyful memories buried at the bottom of their hearts.<br>Then she began to dance, as lightly as a Crystalfly flutters, dispelling their unease and dispersing the rampant panic like a floral fragrance drifting in on the east wind at dawn.<br>Having regained their peace of mind, all were able to pass the day without wallowing in fear.<br>This was the first time that they had slept peacefully since the crisis descended upon the forest.<br>After returning to her little hut, Nilou sat there and began to quietly flip through the pages of her book, trying to learn more about Simulanka.<br>According to the records, the Forest Fairy's arrival was the crucial sign, heralding that the Hero of Prophecy was finally coming to rally their companions.<br>But Nilou did not take this to mean salvation was a given, nor did she sit still and do nothing. Instead, she kept searching for more specific knowledge to find a way to turn the prophecy into reality.<br>Her aim was to bestow a magical blessing upon the origami inhabitants by staging a grand yet heartfelt dance, and in doing so, resolve the crisis once and for all.<br>And just as she wished, the rest of the story played out in the mildest manner imaginable.<br>All their waiting had not been in vain, their perseverance rewarded finally with a happy resolution.<br>Long after leaving the dreamlike realm of Simulanka, the emotion of that time still resides within this dress; even now, as Nilou dances, the joyful fragrance of ink lingers upon every breath that she takes.<br>Yet Nilou never wondered why she was chosen as the Forest Fairy—<br>Perhaps her so-called blessing was this — in a future as deep and distant as the night sky where good and evil coexist, she lit up a star to show people how to find their way through the most beautiful of thoughts.<br>If this blessing had been conceived by someone who approached every moment in life with gentle-heartedness, this star would have shined with a limited brilliance, a light that would often have failed to penetrate the complex nature of reality.<br>Only one who was as pure as the morning dew, listening to the unsullied kindness of their inner voice, could have offered up such a sincere, effective blessing that would be accepted by the world."
