In Candace's view, the village rules are the most important thing. So long as these boundaries are respected, anyone can be allowed to rest in Aaru Village.<br>But woe betide those who regard this tolerance as weakness.

Candace, burdened as she is with multiple identities, also bears the eternal responsibility of guarding Aaru Village.<br>\"This village only welcomes those who can follow the rules.\"",

At last, a clang of lance against shield silenced all the quarrels. With lance and shield in her hand, Candace stood up and looked around with a smile, before announcing to the stunned elderly folks around her:<br>\"It is good to see you all in such good spirits.\"<br>\"But I am the current Guardian of Aaru Village, so please, go and rest, as you should.\"<br>The persuasive power of weapons trumped words at this moment, and it seemed that it would be enough to end the fracas.<br>After a moment's preparation, Candace accompanied the village head in her station as Guardian to formally receive the caravan and hold trade negotiations with them, before personally escorting them out of the village.<br>A few days later, the merchants visited again and completed this seemingly humble transaction regarding cloths.<br>This batch of merchants returned to Sumeru City with news of the success of the deal. Soon after, a new topic cropped up among the business-folk of Sumeru, one which had been rarely heard of in the past:<br>\"Hey, you know what? Someone went to Aaru Village to do business — and they made a good sum of Mora, too. Think we should give it a shot next time...?\"",

From introductions to accommodations, she arranges everything in good order.<br>Perhaps she might even be too gentle for the merchants' comfort.<br>After all, this village is next to Great Red Sand. Leaving the monsters aside, lawless bandits must have long had this village in their sights.<br>Is the Guardian truly capable of protecting everyone... and their business as well?<br>One night, a drunken merchant dared to ask:<br>\"Guardian, we can do business in this village, no problem. But as you know, this desert is a real den of outlaws...\"<br>\"You need not worry about this. Only those who obey the rules shall be guests in Aaru Village. As for those who don't...\"",

Their despicable souls shall find company only with the desert sands.<br>A former member of the Eremites once warned his companions that Candace, the terrifying Guardian of the village, is a true descendant of King Deshret.<br>The shield in her hand possesses the blessing of Al-Ahmar, such that as long as its wielder holds it tightly, every grain in the great desert will heed her call. So if Candace so wishes, she could even send forth a huge sandstorm to engulf all her foes.<br>Not only that, her amber left eye can also perceive the future and read the fates of others. Indeed, such is her terrible might that none can ever escape her pursuit.<br>Such are people's beliefs concerning Candace, that she has swept all of Aaru Village's enemies away by virtue of these divine powers.",

Some gave up and became so despondent that they stopped practicing martial arts. Some came to believe that since they were not being watched, they didn't have to obey the rules either, and so acted recklessly, even in violation of the law.<br>But Candace was not depressed.<br>\"My lance and shield are not wielded as a prayer for a god's blessing.\"<br>\"My duty will not change, regardless of whether any god favors us or not.\"<br>She practices diligently day after day and through this has forged both an extraordinary will and martial skills.<br>Many who have visited Aaru Village have extended invitations to Candace, wondering why someone as capable as her would choose to live in such an inconspicuous place. If she was willing to leave, they often say, she may yet be able to start a new career...<br>Yet Candace always answers them thusly:<br>\"A Guardian will not leave what they have purposed to protect.\"",

Gradually, people tried to go out to make a living, and fewer and fewer young people were willing to stay in the village.<br>The former Guardians had long been dissatisfied with Candace, who, as they saw it, had \"abandoned\" their traditions.
