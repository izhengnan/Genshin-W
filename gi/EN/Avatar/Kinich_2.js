                "Content": "Natlan is a nation where humans and Saurians live side-by-side, and this mutualism has lasted for many years.<br>Such relationships are for the most part friendly, with humans and Saurians as bosom companions.<br>But this does not mean that all Saurians approach humans with friendly intent. Even today, quite a few deaths still occur due to Saurian attacks.<br>This is why Saurian Hunters — of which Kinich happens to be a leading member — exist, deeply familiar with the weaknesses of Saurians as they are.<br>He is of no great age, nor has he been trained by any great master, but through many years of living out in the wild, he has learned the techniques by which he subdues wild beasts and wicked Saurians alike.<br>Like a natural born hunter, he is steady, direct, and efficient, watching his prey with a gaze as sharp as a boning knife.<br>But unlike other Saurian Hunters, Kinich is far from limited by this profession. Rumor has it that for the right price, he will also prove himself to be adept at wet work.<br>It is because of this that many in the tribe keep a distance from him — though of course, some also do so on account of his realistic, utilitarian approach to life.<br>Regardless of whom he receives his commission from, even if they're a person in a bind, or still a child, he will always request the remuneration he deems suitable.<br>Nothing can change this belief of his — that all things come at a cost. Such actions provoke confusion, but Kinich has no intention of explaining himself.<br>If you must have an explanation, you can get one, but only after he sticks out an open palm and asks: \"And what price are you willing to pay for that?\"",

                "Content": "Before he was seven, Kinich lived with his family.<br>His father was a courier who took three days off for every one day of work and made a pastime out of taking his day's wages to the betting tables, seeking to make far more than he wagered.<br>If he won, he would bring Kinich a box of expensive sweets and hand-pick lovely flowers for his wife.<br>If he lost, he would borrow some money from a colleague to get himself drunk, all the better to cover up his utter lack of earnings or winnings.<br>But Kinich's mother remained lucid and would argue with him constantly while holding the little Kinich. At times, the man would admit his fault, promising to never gamble again.<br>But other times, a kitchenware-shattering domestic war would break out, in which the victor would invariably be Kinich's father, stronger in body as he was, with his defeated mother left to quietly tend to the crops they grew in their backyard—<br>This resilient woman was not adept at fighting but was an excellent farmer. And just as well, too, for there were three mouths to feed in that house.<br>Not long afterward, Kinich's father would go on to lose their house, forcing them to move to the foot of a mountain, far from their tribe.<br>This arrangement was not without its benefits, for it did come with a larger plot of land. Here, Kinich learned to plant Grainfruit, twist castor oil plants into rope, mix tapioca flour to make thick noodles, and learn the art of trap-making to hunt for forest boars.<br>But the ills were more evident, for any violence here had no hope of neighborly mediation, the injuries he and his mother would suffer contingent only on his father's state of drunkenness.<br>One night, his mother snuck out and left without making the slightest noise, leaving her young son behind, perhaps for fear that her husband might pursue her to the ends of the earth otherwise.<br>Kinich does not recall if she said goodbye to him, but nonetheless, he ably succeeded her housework, farmwork, hunting-craft, and beatings.<br>As he grew, however, Kinich gradually found means of escape. His athleticism proved exceptional, and as he grew faster each day, his father grew less able to catch him.<br>Each time he all but flew out the door, the wind would briefly conceal his father's enraged yells, granting him a rare moment of freedom.<br>And perhaps fate itself had pity on him, for he was soon to experience true freedom. On his seventh birthday, for the very first time, he asked his father if he had news of his mother.<br>No words were needed for the answer to present itself. His father pursued him, eyes shot through with hangover red, aiming to give him a piece of his mind... But long years of drinking had left the man's body with a shadow of its former strength. As the chase led them past a precipice, he lost his footing by mistake, plummeting off the cliff.<br>By the time Kinich had reacted, the man with whom he had lived for many years lay at the bottom of a col, unmoving as a forest boar tired of struggling in a snare. He would never again get up.<br>The first thing Kinich felt was a daze, almost like being snow-blind, before a staggering sourness knocked him out of that torpid haze.<br>Only by squeezing his eyes shut, scrunching his nose, and breathing deeply, warping and twisting his face in the process, did he manage to hold in the tears.<br>After some time, he knew not how long, he picked up his father's grappling hook and dragged the man's stiffened body back home.<br>His father had never taught him how to use such equipment, but Kinich had learned just by watching in secret a few times. Now, he blitzed past one tree branch after another, the wind whizzing in his ears.<br>On his seventh birthday, the mountains had sent him the gift of freedom — but when he opened the box, he found naught but solitude within.",

                "Content": "After his parents' successive departures, Kinich would continue living beneath that mountain.<br>He lived thus: planting, weaving, hunting, going to the tribal market to exchange his quarry for other necessities.<br>As time passed, this silent lad would make a deeper impression on the adults of the tribal assembly.<br>Some were worried that he might have difficulty living, and so attempted to provide help, only to be rejected by a shake of his head.<br>As little Kinich saw things, nothing in this world was free, and seen in that light, free help was far more suspicious than goods with openly stated prices.<br>It could be bait, like that which he incorporated into his hunting traps, revealing its hidden cost only later.<br>And so, he would conscientiously drift along the edges of the tribe, keeping all who approached him at arm's length.<br>Each time he came to the tribe, he would simply trade for the things he needed, then depart right away, never tarrying for long.<br>All this was witnessed by Elder Leik, who was in charge of teaching the children.<br>Having interacted with the boy's parents while dealing with the matter of child education in the Scions of the Canopy, he was one of the few people familiar with Kinich's family circumstances.<br>And so, he proposed a special transaction to the boy when he visited the market.<br>He wanted Kinich to attend the tribe's Learning Lodge, for children of the tribe who were seven to eight years old should all attend school.<br>As for fees, he could run errands in lieu of payment, for Leik needed a courier to deliver impromptu notices to the students.<br>However, Kinich rejected the offer all the same, for he was too young to understand the value of education, and he could hunt seven or even eight forest boars in the time it took to run the errands — hardly a good trade.<br>Leik was quite dumbfounded, for in truth the Learning Lodge's lessons came free, and he had only proposed the errands to dispel Kinich's vigilance.<br>Still, the Elder did not give up, spending a whole month explaining the nature of the Lodge to the boy, all the while adjusting the remuneration.<br>At last, they came to an accord. Each time he came to the markets, Kinich would also go to school, in exchange for serving as the Elder's messenger whenever he was free.<br>This trade proved satisfactory to both parties — though neither of them expected that Kinich would require but a single day to graduate.",

                "Content": "Elder Leik happened to be teaching the day that Kinich showed up to school as agreed. The Elder stood at the center of a circle of seated students and motioned for Kinich to find a place to sit.<br>Kinich sat at the circle's outer edge, the other kids looking him up and down inquisitively. The Scions of the Canopy lived simply for the most part, but even amongst them, Kinich was shabbily dressed.<br>Barefoot, he wore an ash-stained headband, a coarse handmade linen shirt, and an animal-skin skirt, making him look like a wild child indeed.<br>\"Why don't you wear shoes?\" A young girl called out. \"Because he's a muddy monkey from the forest,\" jeered a strong-looking lad and his friends.<br>Elder Leik immediately coughed to interrupt them and signal that class was about to start.<br>\"Now, children, today we shall speak of our heroes and their sagas. Can anyone tell me their names?\"<br>\"'Malipo' Burkina!\" \"Master Yupanqui!\" ... The answers rolled forth from the children in waves.<br>\"That's right. Every one of our heroes deserves to be remembered, not only for their strength, but also for their spirit of self-sacrifice.\"<br>At this moment, Kinich raised his hand from where he sat, furthest beyond the circle. \"Why would they want to sacrifice themselves?\"<br>\"There is no particular why or wherefore. That is simply a virtue innate to heroes,\" the Elder replied. \"And what did this virtue get them in return?\" Kinich asked again.<br>\"Virtue is a thing beyond price. It cannot be exchanged for anything, for it is a reward from the heavens.\"<br>\"A reward?\" Kinich's doubts had not been assuaged. \"What sort of reward, exactly? Fame? Mora?\"<br>\"All these, of course, but they were not the key. The key is virtue itself, for it is the basis of noble character, and that is what makes a hero a hero.\"<br>The old scholar closed his book and gave Kinich an earnest look, though the boy had not particularly understood this statement. Instead, he was thinking back on the past—<br>The mountains told him that the forest boar was the noblest of things, for it could fill his stomach. The next noblest was water, for without it, humans would die of thirst.<br>But neither of these were his birthright, and that made them precious. Thus, when he gave them up, he would seek something in return.<br>Mora was the \"something\" he preferred best, for it could be exchanged for many other things.<br>And so he told Elder Leik, \"If I become a hero, I want to be rewarded with Mora.\"<br>How the other children laughed then, the boy who had mocked Kinich foremost amongst them. \"Why don't you go back and swing in your trees then, selfish mud monkey?\"<br>But his little gang was not satisfied with just this. Standing up, they squeezed Kinich out the door. Though Elder Leik tried to stop them, Kinich took the opportunity to leave all the same. He felt no need to stay there any longer, for his keen mind had caught onto a certain truth—<br>These noisy brats in the Lodge were just that — brats. As they gathered to heap praise upon the heroes, it must have seemed to them that they had become the companions of those heroes, sharing in their nobility. But such false glory would not teach them how to fill their tummies. Once school was over, every single one of them would have to return home and be fed by their mothers.<br>Kinich could have taught them a lesson right there, too. Laid a couple out for half a month or so, just to let them know how far they were from being heroes.<br>But what use was there in giving out free life lessons... emphasis on \"free\"?<br>Still, this class was not an entirely fruitless endeavor. If nothing else, he now had some answers to his doubts.<br>He knew what he must do in the future. Become a hero — for the Mora, that is.",

                "Content": "A hero needs to be strong, that much cannot be contested. Not long after he graduated from the Learning Lodge, he would seek Elder Leik out on his own to suggest how he might gain this strength.<br>To secure the Elder's approval, he even brought all he owned, hoping that it might constitute a worthy price:<br>Grappling hooks and trap-making equipment, freshly-harvested castor beans, two large pots of tapioca flour, a bag of Grainfruit seeds, a freshly-slaughtered forest boar, and a small amount of Mora.<br>The Elder laughed and rejected Kinich's offer of remuneration, on one condition, that Kinich learn what it truly meant to be a hero on his journey.<br>In truth, the Elder had always cherished high hopes for the boy, for he could see a reflection of the ancient heroes within him.<br>At the same time, he believed that Kinich required proper guidance, for should he set out on the wrong path, he could do far greater damage than your average villain. Thus, a new trade was agreed upon.<br>In this way, Kinich would live alongside Elder Leik in the mountains and forests for many years.<br>And even as the Elder taught Kinich about the history of Natlan and the heroes of its various tribes, he would also recommend many notables to the lad.<br>A fletcher who made special arrowheads, a witch doctor specializing in Saurian poisons, an old hunter skilled in the use of ropes and grappling hooks, an expert in escape and evasion from dire situations...<br>Kinich would never reject such expertise, and learned much from them day and night, but this alone did not satisfy him, and on designated rest days, he would return to the mountains to hone his combat skills.<br>Without a formal teacher in this regard, he would imitate the motions of wild animals as they hunted. Some were agile, others cunning, and others fierce, and so he took their strengths and incorporated them into his own unique martial arts.<br>As his abilities grew, Elder Leik would also guide Kinich to take on more duties within the tribe, beginning with courier work.<br>Kinich proved skilled at this beyond even many adults, doing all that they could in half the time.<br>With his skills, it was no surprise that people would gradually come to him, offering payment in exchange for more dangerous services, including the slaying of powerful Saurians.<br>The Elder initially assumed that Kinich might come to ask his opinion, but not once did this happen.<br>In this regard, the young man was like a veteran of over ten years, always able to judge the merits of any commission and negotiate suitable payment.<br>And when there was falsehood or concealment involved in such commissions, Kinich would forcefully weigh the cost upon the scales of his heart and adjust the price accordingly, regardless of whether the other party might refuse.<br>Such behavior, of course, led to some criticism, and there were important folk even within the tribe who felt that Kinich did not give his work enough care.<br>But the young man would never explain himself, simply continuing to set the prices he saw fit for each assignment he was given.<br>Even Elder Trinidad, who had charge over ritual matters, took issue with this at one point, and sought to summon the lad for questioning. However, Elder Leik stopped him.<br>\"Come now, no need for all this fuss. The lad knows what he's doing.\"<br>\"It's preposterous! The Scions of the Canopy have never called any such person a hero!\"<br>\"And that's where you're mistaken. He has never been a Scion of the Canopy. He is a scion of the mountains — the only sort of hero he will become is the sort he wishes to be.\"",

There they lived out their entire lives, before climbing up to the surface to mate before dying.<br>Thus did they live for generations, until one day, a great upheaval shook the under-earth, and the soil temperature surged, killing off the crickets in their droves.<br>The remaining survivors chose to hide by burrowing ever deeper — all save the protagonist, a champion amongst crickets who chose instead to climb back up to the surface.<br>It wished to know what had transpired above, and see if there was some way to resolve this crisis.<br>But when it emerged, it found that the once-verdant mountains had been rendered desolate by the war between humans and monsters.<br>Plants had withered, the earth was scorched, and drifting ash blotted out the sun, the air now choked with phlogiston, deadly poison to cricket-kind — for this was the land that in latter days would be called the Mare Jivari.<br>The cricket hero, filled with resentment, fell to the blackened ground, but as its life's spark faded, it used up the last of its strength to lay a single cracked crystal egg ...<br>The story ends abruptly here, with none ever knowing if a little cricket might come forth from that egg, and that was the key reason for Elder Leik's low opinion of the tale.<br>Yet that was exactly why Kinich liked it — for it meant that he could look forward to the day when he might see the ending of this manuscript.",

The final bar line had been inked.<br>Kinich, last of the Night Warden warriors, was slain.<br>Ajaw closed his eyes to give the fallen their due respect... only to open them to a stunning sight.<br>Kinich's fallen form had risen, his hands, just now bloodless and white, gripping his claymore tightly.<br>Thus did \"Kinich\" plunge into the Abyssal tide once more, his tireless blade flashing across the battlefield...<br>Recovering from the shock, Ajaw looked closely, and lo! A heart-patterned, emerald-hued gem now hung where Kinich's chest had been pierced — though when it had appeared, he knew not.<br>From it flowed vibrant life, driving Kinich's unconscious form on, transforming him into an indefatigable beast of instinct, tearing into the monsters until every last one was no more...<br>...<br>When Kinich next opened his eyes, he found himself back at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, people all around singing the searing Ode of Resurrection.<br>He turned to see his comrades, bathed in streaming song, awakening one by one.<br>\"We... won? But who...\" Kinich mumbled, grabbing at his chest. He was so sure that he had fallen before the forces of the Abyss.<br>But someone must have intervened to grant them victory, for otherwise, the Ode would not have revived them.<br>\"What claptrap are you spouting? You did it, you demented, hard-scrabbling, lucky little grasshopper!\" Ajaw, splayed out on the floor and clearly frustrated, threw a stone his way. \"Bah! Was gaining my succor insufficient for you? Clearly! And now you've gone and gotten a Vision... Oh, when will your body be mine to use!?\"<br>...<br>The night he was given new life, Kinich leaned back on his bed, running his fingers over his emerald Vision.<br>Sights flashed before his eyes. The crowd swarming him, the thunderous applause, the sacred, burning Ode of Resurrection...<br>It came to him then, out of the blue, that he had deviated from his original goal.<br>He had struck out to become a hero for Mora's sake, but now, he fought for something far more precious.<br>His comrades, his homeland, the laughter and joy of the people... He knew not when this process had begun. Indeed, the seeds of change may have been sown long before.<br>\"We remember our heroes not only for their strength, but for their spirit of self-sacrifice...\"<br>\"That is a virtue innate to heroes...\" \"For it is the basis of noble character, and that is what makes a hero a hero.\"<br>Kinich faintly recalled Elder Leik's first lesson.
