At present, Lisa's job is to oversee the book collection in the library owned by the Knights.",

However, additional danger means an additional workload — and that is something that she would never be able to accept.",

How much did one have to sacrifice to attain the profoundest knowledge of all?<br>Put off by this realization, Lisa decided to leave Sumeru.<br>Since then, Lisa has always stopped short of taking things too seriously.<br>\"Before demanding too many miracles from the gods, first consider if you are willing to pay the price they ask.\"<br>These words she has spoken to just three people since arriving in Mondstadt. In each case, it was because she knew it was what they needed to hear.",

It features time-delay heating, semi-automated ingredient insertion, and temperature regulation functions.<br>Lisa spent an enormous budget and commandeered the alchemy workshop for two full weeks in order to build this extraordinary piece of equipment.<br>She boasts that the cauldron is capable of completing any precision heating task to perfection with a maximum of just two pulls of a lever.<br>But her most common application for it is to brew tea and keep it at the optimal temperature while she is managing her books.<br>After all, a relaxing afternoon tea session is by far the most important part of Lisa's day.",

I suppose I shall need a Vision, then.\"<br>And just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.<br>With the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.<br>For whatever reason, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.<br>The Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.<br>So, from time to time, when somebody whom she finds interesting comes along, Lisa will pass onto them her understanding on all kinds of matters.<br>Perhaps she is secretly hoping that by doing so, one day someone will come along who has the ability to understand the ultimate truth behind Visions.",

Thus, they began to use different species of flowers as amusing nicknames for each other.<br>It was unanimously agreed that the Akademiya was full of \"Sweet Flowers\" and \"Mints,\" but \"Roses\" and \"Padisarahs\" were individuals of vanishing rarity.<br>Thus, it was baffling to many that the genius Lisa Minci possessed all the qualities of a \"Padisarah\" but cared little even to claim the title of \"Rose.\"<br>As an academic, she finished a great many projects left incomplete by those who came before her, and also possessed a solid grasp of theory.<br>Her accomplishments earned her the regard of her instructors, and soon she was allowed to study even the most complex of topics. In little time, she began contributing to the advancement of her new studies as well.<br>At that time, certain researchers even thought that she could become the youngest sage in history — provided she made a few adjustments to her field of study, of course.<br>Yet, she didn't participate in the official signing ceremony that would certify her academic accomplishments, choosing instead to withdraw from the main project she was studying in her Darshan, before leaving the Akademiya altogether.<br>When faced with the confusion radiating from her classmates' questions, she merely replied as elegantly and affably as she always did:<br>\"My work can be compared to rearranging a mess of books and putting them all back in their rightful place, that's all. With that in mind, it's unnecessary for me to claim something so serious as an official title.\"<br>\"Also, do you remember that song that was so popular amongst us students?\"<br>\"'We beg not for the Kalpalata Lotus' mystery, we struggle not to claim the Padisarah's purity.'\"<br>\"'For with poetry by our sides, their fragrance ever lingers in our lives.'\"<br>\"In times past, the rose was a flower precious without peer. But after generations of scholars worked tirelessly to cultivate them, roses can now be found wherever the sunlight shines.\"<br>\"But is this bad for the roses? Well, of course not. Rare or common, the roses remain as fragrant as ever. Their preciousness was but a label we gave them.\"<br>\"As such, if there comes a day when everyone ceases to regard these flowers so subjectively and instead judges them with consideration to their growth habits and choice of environments... That day's coming, I think, might be something worthier of commemoration.\""
