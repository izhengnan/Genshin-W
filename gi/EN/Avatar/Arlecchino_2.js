Indeed, nearby residents have not even heard of her.<br>The signature on the relevant documentation is but a false identity — the real power lies with someone else.<br>If one could hear the children whisper at night behind the Hotel's closed gates, one would hear this appellation: \"Father.\"<br>When speaking of \"Father,\" some faces turn worshipful, some hearts are seized with fear, and still others look inscrutable, torn — but their tone always becomes one of respect.<br>These children are part of the organization known as the House of the Hearth. They belong to the Fatui.<br>This place is home to orphans the world over, and the luxurious Hotel is but one of the House's faces.<br>As for this \"Father,\" the master of the House, she is none other than The Knave, Arlecchino, presently Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers.<br>The Fatui — and this Harbinger — enjoy a mixed reputation. But to most of these children, \"Father\" is the most important figure in their lives.<br>\"It is only because 'Father' is here that this place is truly like a 'home.'\"",

Not her hobbies, her dislikes, or the things on her mind when she gazes out to sea.<br>Each August, they rack their brains thinking of birthday presents for her, and yet her reactions to each gift are virtually the same.<br>This continued until last year, when Freminet was given a nasty shock by a lizard that leaped down from the ceiling. The little \"invader\" was caught by Lynette's sharp eyes and quick fingers and then imprisoned on top of the table by a bowl she swiftly seized.<br>Both bowl and lizard wound up being taken for that year's gift by The Knave, who just happened to return home at that moment.<br>The next day, when Lyney entered \"Father\"'s office to give a report, he found a familiar figure in the feeding box.<br>The temperature and humidity within the box seemed to be eminently suitable for the little lizard, which seemed to be quite enjoying itself.<br>\"Father\" seemed to have experience in rearing reptiles.<br>As The Knave raised her teacup, Lyney immediately shifted his gaze away from the lizard, but he quietly noted this incident to himself.<br>The children seize every opportunity they can to get closer to their \"Father,\" after all.<br>Thus, Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet began looking up all sorts of knowledge regarding raising lizards, hoping to have something to discuss with \"Father\" when next they saw her.<br>But just a few days later, when he next set foot in her office, the box was already empty.<br>\"'Father'... What happened to that lizard?\"<br>\"It attempted to open the box lid a few times, so I gave it back its freedom. Our acquaintance was brief indeed, but that was the choice life made.\"<br>The Knave's voice was completely calm. Looking at the confused Lyney, she then directed a casual finger at a bird that was poking about at the windowsill.<br>\"Ah, yes. Not long after it left, the lizard became this one's lunch. Now it seems to want me to serve it seconds... Go chase it away.\"",

They begin to surreptitious don accessories and trim their split hairs with scissors.<br>Rebellious little tendencies such as these are of no concern to \"Father,\" nor will she interfere.<br>But should a child reveal their position during a night operation on account of a necklace she would not lay aside — now this would require a \"Father\"'s instruction.<br>Thus did Arlecchino enter that girl's room, a lovely handbag in hand.<br>The necklace had already been taken off and placed on the table, and the girl stood trembling next to it. She knew her error.<br>Arlecchino scooped up the necklace and gazed upon it, before walking over and looping it back around the girl's unblemished neck.<br>She then lifted the flowing gold locks around the child's ears. \"Oh, you pierced them yourself.\"<br>And so \"Father\" once more retrieved velvet ribbon and jeweled earrings from that bag, tying the girl's hair with the former, and affixing the latter to her ears.<br>Then, taking her by the shoulders, she guided the girl before the mirror. The young lady reflected within was as a gem-encrusted noble rose, her beauty shining through the unease that blazed across her features.<br>\"It is normal to be vain at your age. But do not let these beautiful trinkets arouse vanity and dull your intellect.\"<br>\"I'm sorry, 'Father,'\" the young woman anxiously apologized, her terror evident.<br>With quivering hands she reached for the earrings, making to unfasten them. \"It won't happen again, I swear...\"<br>But the mirror showed only \"Father\"'s unwavering calm, her smile seemingly undimmed.<br>\"Shh... Do not be so nervous. People often long for that which they cannot have, and it would not do for regret to make beautiful memories seem ever rosier.\"<br>\"Wear them. Once you have grown accustomed to them, you will realize that no gem, however exquisite, is any more than an object, cold and dead.\"<br>\"This is your new lesson — to understand the source of your emotions.

To her, the unnumbered sacrifices were but an interesting experiment.<br>...<br>Before taking the title of The Knave and changing her name to Arlecchino, the young girl had another name: Peruere.<br>She was an orphan of unknown origin, like all others in the House of the Hearth — a \"child\" of their \"Mother.\"<br>Many knew that \"Mother\" favored her especially, indeed, caring far more for Peruere than even her own biological daughter, Clervie.<br>As such, even to the last, few understood why Peruere repaid this kindness with a magnificent assassination.<br>Crucabena's insane experimentation took place far from prying eyes, so naturally, almost none knew of them.<br>Peruere was thus tarred as having committed \"matricide,\" her madness known to all.<br>...<br>Even after the dust had settled, she who had once been Peruere — and was now Arlecchino — did not offer any explanation.<br>She indulged the spread of these rumors, and indeed added fuel to the fire from the shadows.<br>Whether as a diplomat or assassin, one profits most from seeing through the other party while keeping oneself shrouded in mystery.<br>A small tombstone stands at the site where she slew their \"Mother,\" the eulogy penned by her hand.<br>\"Here the last light of the setting sun lies buried.

But at her young age, this seemed like no ability to be boasted of so much as a deep-rooted curse.<br>Each time she let her vigilance wane, this power would run rampant, eating away at her body. First her fingers, then her palms, and then her forearms...<br>The blackened marks were akin to those of burned charcoal, just as she seemed akin to burning firewood.<br>Here she had a vague foreboding, that if this dark shadow were to creep up her shoulder, and snake from shoulder to heart, she would likely undergo some sort of \"change.\"<br>Perhaps that would be the moment fate tipped its hand to her.<br>...<br>Even without the corrosion, this flame brought her other troubles.<br>Those rendered ash by these fires would leave \"afterimages.\" At times, they were fragments of memory, and at others, they donned the aspect of dazzling colors.<br>As those who fell at her hand increased, Arlecchino began to hear various voices.<br>Screams, wails, and hurled recriminations would wake her from dreams, and she soon grew used to this. She had few dreams worth remembering fondly, in any case, filled as most were with crimson moon and barren wilds.<br>In cases few and far between, these afterimages would be complete enough to take on the form of a \"conscious individual.\"<br>Of course, these were hardly as special as \"Clervie's shadow,\" but they would still appear by Arlecchino's side, driving the clamor away and buying her a moment's respite.<br>Like children at play, they would gather for a time, and then drift away as they pleased.<br>Arlecchino remembered who they were in life.

What do my constant dreams of a crimson moon and my powers mean?\"<br>\"I once served the final dynasty of an ancient underground kingdom.

What will become of me and the others in the House of the Hearth once everything is finished?\"<br>\"I will be frank. None of you have any place in my ideals, for I plan only to uphold 'the virtue of folly.' But I can guarantee that our Tsaritsa will once again be a god who loves all humans, and in her ideals shall all human wishes be granted.\"<br>This \"virtue of folly\" was, of course, left enigmatic, but she accepted this answer nonetheless.
