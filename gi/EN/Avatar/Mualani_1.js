Sharky's Bites can take place in mid-air. DMG dealt this way is considered Normal Attack DMG.<br> · When she makes contact with opponents in this state, Mualani applies \"Marked as Prey\" to them and gains 1 Wave Momentum stack. Max 3 stacks. 1 stack can be gained every 0.7s per opponent.<br><br><color style='color:#FFD780;'>Wave Momentum and Marked as Prey</color><br>When Mualani uses Sharky's Bite, her DMG dealt increases based on Wave Momentum stacks. When she has 3 stacks, a Normal Attack will use Sharky's Surging Bite instead, further increasing her DMG and canceling all stacks thereafter.<br>When Shark Bite hits opponents Marked as Prey, that mark is removed, and she will fire Shark Missiles at up to 5 nearby opponents Marked as Prey, dealing DMG to them equal to this Sharky's Bite instance and clearing their Marks. If more than 1 opponent is the target of Sharky's Bite and Shark Missiles, the DMG dealt will decrease, with 28% being the maximum decrease when at least 3 opponents are targeted.<br><br><i>First off, Sharky is a freshwater shark on top of being a surfboard. Second, it doesn't truly need to eat, but it definitely will bite.</i>",
