Icy for hot weather, spicy in cold climes.<br>And on days when hearts frigid grow like falling flakes of snow, all long for a nice hot and hearty bowl.<br>What warms the mouth, warms the heart in turn, after all.<br>And when one speaks of hearty warmth, a hot pot comes to mind. Yes, mutton hotpot. Why not?<br>A bowl of delicious mutton soup and the company of close friends is the best way to end the year, after all.<br>And if she could satisfy her own picky taste buds, surely the customers, too, would be pleased.<br><br>And in truth, the ingredients needed for said soup were quite simple. Indeed, a friend of hers had already volunteered to buy them at her behest.<br>The difficult part was mixing the dipping sauce. This she would see to in person.<br>Of course, Guoba was welcome to help if he was interested. They could have some mutton soup together later.<br>The thick sauces, readied all-year round on the stove, must first be thinned a little, then mixed in homemade shrimp oil, before being mixed with cooled boiled water.<br>The small leafy veggies she diced, before Guoba mulched them and the condiments into a paste, which she then poured into the sauce bowl alongside the fermented tofu — the latter a Wanmin secret recipe.<br>Brown, green, red... Many flavors filled the bowl, together forming the warmest memory from every winter.<br>Ah, but not so fast — it is a Wanmin Restaurant tradition to pour on a spoonful of fried-on-the-spot Jueyun Chili oil atop the fresh seasoning mix.<br>The chilis themselves must be dried and de-seeded before boiling vegetable oil is poured onto them, and in a flash, forth pours a fragrant spiciness.<br>And with that spoonful of chili oil, the mutton hotpot sauce is ready.<br>Of course, such strong and appetizing smells are to kick up some steam — Xiangling and Guoba were barely able to stifle a simultaneous sneeze.<br>Oh, when was Hu Tao coming back with the meat? She could barely wait to get this hotpot started!"
