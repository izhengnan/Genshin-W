Despite her departure long ago, her name is still praised in the stories told in every household in Sumeru.<br>On the other hand, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was whisked back by the sages to the Sanctuary of Surasthana following the former's fall, has been more of a symbol — one that signifies that the protection of divinity never ceased to exist on this land.<br>But the answers to who she is, how she descended, and what powers she has, are rarely known.<br>From the highest sage's vague response and evasive attitude toward people's inquiry about Lesser Lord Kusanali, the people in Sumeru deduced that they should no longer expect merciful wisdom to descend from on high as before.<br>The Akasha, the sublime legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, is just as handy and helpful as it has always been. What people are not aware of is that the Akasha today has become the ears and eyes of the newborn deity.<br>Through the Akasha, she has observed every bit of human emotions and attitudes. She is aware of their devotion to the old goddess, their disillusionment with their new deity, and the many comments that \"The God of Wisdom will never come back.\"<br>She knows in her heart that she must keep learning and grow up as quickly as she can to stand up and face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world. This is her inevitable duty.<br>Thus, whether she is misunderstood or underappreciated, Nahida makes no argument against it.",

Only through that can she enrich her experience, honing her skills to become powerful enough to face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world.<br>There is no escape from this, her inexorable duty.<br>Even though very few feel unsatisfied with the status quo, Nahida still remains steadfast.

As she learns more knowledge, her dreams become even more intricate and full of life.<br>The dreams not only relax her mind, but also give her chances to examine her new knowledge to see if it goes against common sense or if she is missing any details.<br>When Dusk Birds first appeared in Nahida's dream, those birds soared through the sky in a standing posture with their wings folded.<br>It looked abnormal and caught Nahida's attention immediately. Nahida thus learned how wings worked, after which the Dusk Birds could fly freely in her dreams.<br>Next, she adopted similar methods to fix Shroomboars that slept underwater, Radishes that grew on apple trees, and crystalflies with mismatched wing colors.<br>Knowledge shall not be a mere approach to justify things in this world, it could also be used to satisfy her need for pure innocent fun.<br>Technically, Shroomboars can only walk on the ground. Now that she understood how wings work, wouldn't Shroomboars with wings fly all the same?<br>And where there are flying Shroomboars, it is only natural to have crocodiles that walk on their hind legs and Harra Fruits who speak human languages...<br>The way Nahida develops her knowledge system has subsequently created a little amusement park for her, free of disturbance. In her dreams, she is in the embrace of boundless happiness.",
