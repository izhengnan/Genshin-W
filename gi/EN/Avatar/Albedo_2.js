The few commonly known alchemy techniques of today are but enough to put some broken odds and ends together, saving you the money you would have otherwise spent on glue.<br>\"Nay, alchemy is not so ignoble an art!\" Or so most alchemists would protest.<br>But as far as the average citizen of Mondstadt was concerned, that was alchemy.<br>At least until the day Albedo suddenly appeared and decided to stay in Mondstadt.<br>This young man displayed the true prowess of alchemy to all, bringing with him a massive corpus of wisdom that even the Sumeru Akademiya did not possess.<br>\"The universe is heaven reversed, and the earth is a dream lost to time. This is dust, the most basic form of complex life.\"<br>As if to provide evidence for this claim, Albedo lifted the burnt ash of the flower that once grew atop a Dendro Slime's head.<br>Seconds later, a Cecilia sprouted forth from the ash in his hand.<br>\"And this... is new life.\"",

In fact, he is earnest in all his dealings.<br>He is, however, of the persuasion that it requires more energy to maintain relationships established on excessive enthusiasm.<br>As a result, Albedo's equivalent of friendship involves maintaining an appropriate degree of distance.<br>On days when he shuts himself away in his laboratory to focus on his work, or heads out into the wild to gather materials, no one in Mondstadt will be able to find him.<br>Yet Albedo's tendency to avoid social interactions does not make him a cold-hearted person.<br>He delights in giving guidance to his assistants, Timaeus and Sucrose.<br>He finds pleasure in giving his sketches to the citizens of Mondstadt.<br>Yet he cannot help but feel sincere disappointment that Lisa, for all her great talents, has chosen to remain a mere Librarian.",

And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm... I know!\"<br>And just like that, she threw him into the Knights of Favonius.<br>The work of the Knights was actually quite easy for Albedo, requiring only five percent of his energy.<br>The rest of his energy could be spent on experiments, with the Knights' full range of apparatus at his disposal, he thought.<br>And yet...<br>Alice has a daughter, named Klee.<br>Yes, \"that\" Klee.<br>\"We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!\"<br>From that day forth, cleaning up after Klee would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy...",

Life was uneventful, its meaning consisted of nothing more than accompanying his teacher, doing what she asked of him, and meeting her expectations.<br>But one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, master and apprentice discovered an artifact known as The Heart of Naberius.<br>And with that, his master disappeared, leaving naught but a note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text behind.<br>Upon the note was written: \"Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment.\"<br>The classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master's collection.<br>If one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.<br>In the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult.<br>He had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.<br>But this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.<br>Did this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again?<br>\"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world.\"",

As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life.<br>This art of creation was known as \"The Art of Khemia.\"<br>Albedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master's notes.<br> The next stage after \"soil\" is \"chalk,\" which was also something his master had mentioned.<br>\"Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man.\"<br>Now, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, and his knowledge on the subject is far more comprehensive.<br>\"From soil was birthed chalk.\"<br>The profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo now.<br>Such ineffable secrets are bound up with his fond memories of his master.<br>She was not his birth mother, but there is no doubt that his life stems from her.<br>\"I hope this isn't just wishful thinking, but... when parents speak to their children about 'the meaning of this world'... surely they just mean the pursuit of a happy life?\"<br>From time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment.",

But he soon noticed that the process of rendering things in great detail helped him to intimately understand their physical makeup, which was of great utility to his alchemical studies.<br>Additionally, it also allowed him to enter into a pleasant state of clarity, in which he needed only to focus on observation and creating his artwork, and nothing else.<br>Eventually, Albedo became a master artist without ever having received formal tuition.<br>When strolling through Mondstadt, he enjoys sketching and painting all manner of living things, but particularly people in moments of joy.<br>Sometimes, he even gifts his artwork to his unsuspecting models, believing that when a work of art captures a transient moment of enjoyment, it is something worth treasuring.<br>Albedo continued to refine his skills in this manner, going from strength to strength — until one day, when he was taken aback by illustrations from Inazuma.<br>How was it that drawings of such generality could possess such narrative power?<br>Amazed, he decided to give it a go himself.<br>...Eventually, after collaborating with a certain novelist by the name of Xingqiu, \"A Legend of Sword\" was printed and published.<br>Unfortunately, it received lukewarm reviews, being lambasted as \"a dictionary with divine illustrations.\"",
