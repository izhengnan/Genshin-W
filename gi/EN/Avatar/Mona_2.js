Well, you'll see.\"<br>That was the warning Mona received before departing.<br>To Mona's surprise, this successor was none other than the Spark Knight, Klee.<br>The box was still extant, but due to Klee's actions and a series of accidents... Mona unwittingly unraveled the enigma behind the box.<br>\"I—I'm done for. The thing inside this was the dark history of her youth... she will kill me if I go back like this...\"<br>Mona was thus forced to stay in Mondstadt, beginning a bitterly frugal but bountifully fulfilling existence.",

That's a lie.\"<br>\"You've got no chance with him.

The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:<br>\"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting.

I'm wearing these new clothes just to commemorate this momentous occasion as your astrology teacher. You can take this as a sign of... uh, respect.\"<br>Feeling a little guilty, you told yourself to get serious. Slapping the sagging, sleepy cheeks of yours, you forced your eyes open and continued listening to her lecture.<br>\"The laws of matter are actually very simple. Rather, it is the principles that govern humanity that are the most complex. As such, we astrologists...\"<br>All the while, you thought to yourself, don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep, don't... Zzz...<br>\"Heh. What am I going to do with you...\" Your astrology master mutters."
