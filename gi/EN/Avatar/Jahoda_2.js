There's no chance you'll fire me, right...?\"<br>\"How could I?\" her dear boss replied with a gentle smile. \"If you were gone, who would brush Ashru's fur, fill his bowl, or make sure your boss here got a good night's sleep?\"<br>\"W–What? That's the only reason?\"<br>\"Meow-meow, meow–!\"<br>\"Ah! Ashru! You little rascal, get off from my head! That braid took me forever!\"<br>As always, Jahoda caught the mischievous Ashru and threatened to give him a bath, while the troublemaker wriggled wildly, covering her in a storm of cat fur.<br>Nefer watched from the side, chin propped on one hand, smiling softly.<br>This young girl was one of the few people in Nod-Krai who could pique her curiosity.<br>\"Jahoda... what kind of person will you grow into, I wonder?\"<br>Her murmured words were lost in the playful clamor of girl and cat — but Nefer knew that, someday, Jahoda would hear them.<br>\"...And when that day comes, what great things will you have achieved?\"",

                "Content": "When Jahoda was first taken in by the Seahook Gang, or, in her own words, \"recruited,\" she occasionally had trouble sleeping.<br>Sometimes it was the commotion outside. Sometimes, it was a job that hadn't gone smoothly. And sometimes... it was the curiosity she couldn't contain.<br>Noisy crowds were easy enough to handle. The boss had told Jahoda that if she wanted everyone to quiet down, all she had to do was grab whatever was at hand — a cup, a plate, even a chair — and throw it into the crowd while yelling at everyone to be quiet.<br>Jahoda had tried it, and it really worked. She'd leap out of bed, snatch up a stuffed toy, and hurl it out the window, then shout at the top of her lungs. And the thieves outside, staggering around, yelling and drinking, would actually fall silent. After that, Jahoda would mess with her tangled hair, hug her blanket, and flop back into bed. Meanwhile, everyone below would be trying not to laugh as they watched the unlucky one who had been hit by the toy. This time, it was his turn to wash it and sneak it back to Jahoda's bedside, or else their little lady would wake up in a sulk the next morning.<br>A job that didn't go well could leave Jahoda feeling down for a long time. When it got too much, she would slip out of the house and quietly wake Zinaida. Half-asleep, Zinaida would listen as Jahoda mumbled that she'd lost her keys because there were just too many of them in the house, and they all looked the same. Next time, she promised herself, she'd color-code every key... that would solve the problem for sure.<br>\"And remember that time I accidentally fell off the roof and landed right in front of the boss? He was in the middle of negotiating with a rival. So... why did I hand him the apple I was holding? Well... because the boss had been talking for so long, he must've been thirsty! And I only had one apple, so of course it had to go to him. What was I supposed to do, give it to the rival? I mean, sorry... I guess I'll bring two next time...\"<br>Jahoda would ramble on until she finally fell asleep, resting her head on Zinaida's shoulder. Zinaida, having seen this countless times, would carry her back to the house, tuck her into bed, and set a glass of water on the nightstand, knowing that after all that talking, she'd be thirsty in the morning.<br>Of course, the hardest to quiet was her occasional bursts of curiosity.<br>And sometimes, to calm that curiosity... she had to take a few risks.",

                "Content": "As Jahoda grew a bit older, some Seahook Gang members would occasionally have restless nights.<br>Sometimes it was from drinking too much, sometimes from injuries, and sometimes simply because they didn't feel like sleeping.<br>But there was only one time when the entire gang stayed up all night.<br>After a certain \"business deal,\" the gang held a feast to celebrate their victory. That black-hearted merchant had finally gotten his comeuppance, handing over all the money he'd swindled. After returning the victims' share, everyone in the gang was guaranteed a nice cut.<br>At one point during the chaos, when someone reached for a necklace, the merchant had suddenly lunged, almost possessed, trying to snatch it back. He was too frail, though, and the gang easily subdued him.<br>What followed was the same old cliché they'd seen a thousand times. The swindler started bawling, swearing he'd give up everything if they'd just return the pendant. According to him, it held the only picture left of his wife and daughter.<br>These experienced thieves, of course, weren't fooled. Nine out of ten swindlers they'd tied up would use the same excuse to beg for something back, and that \"something\" usually hid a clue to some treasure, a way for them to crawl back from rock bottom. After tossing the merchant a bit of money, the gang headed straight back to their base.<br>But just as everyone had eaten and drunk their fill, and it had come time to divvy up the spoils...<br>\"Wait... Where's Jahoda? She was just here...\"<br>\"Boss, that necklace is gone! C—Could it be...?\"<br>Jahoda had disappeared. And with her went the necklace — neither too expensive nor too cheap, but enough to cause a stir.<br>Silence swept through the hall. The seasoned thieves glanced at one another. None of them believed Jahoda would betray them over some random necklace. Besides, Jahoda probably didn't even know what the word \"betrayal\" meant.<br>At last, Zinaida spoke up, hesitant and uncertain.<br>\"She wouldn't... really have gone to return that necklace, would she...?\"<br>Before she even finished, a small door at the back of the hall creaked open. Jahoda slowly poked her head out. But instead of sneaking back into the noisy, crowded room she'd imagined, she froze at the heavy silence that greeted her.<br>\"S—Sorry... I... I was just in the bathroom...\"<br>The first weary sigh came from the boss, his face buried in his hands. The second came from Zinaida, now certain she'd guessed right. One sigh after another followed, filling the hall, while Jahoda lingered at the doorway, still peeking in, unsure whether she should step inside.<br>\"Jahoda, dear, come here.\"<br>The boss beckoned to the girl, who was fresh off finishing a secret little adventure.<br>\"We're deducting the cost of that necklace from your share, so you'll get nothing this time.\"<br>\"B—But that necklace... Huh? Wh—What necklace? I have no idea what you're talking about! I...\"<br>\"Jahoda.\"<br>\"Yes, Boss!\"<br>\"Quiet. Eat your meal.\"<br>\"Yes, Boss...\"",

                "Content": "By the time Jahoda's childhood came to an end, her enemies were the ones losing sleep.<br>In the past, Ratfan had always trusted in the power of money. It could hire members of the Seahook Gang to take out their own boss, throwing the troublesome gang into disarray. It could buy barrels of oil to burn away all the evidence and scare off the faint-hearted. And most importantly, it could be used to buy valuable intelligence from that mysterious businesswoman.<br>The hidden powers that once controlled Nasha Town were gone, leaving only money as the path to power.<br>But the hunter who had set his sights on him didn't need it.<br>\"Enough! Show yourself! What do you want from me!?\"<br>The burly man bellowed into the silent forest. His camp had just been raided again. Somehow, the small, wiry assassin had slipped inside, effortlessly taking down one guard after another. She had pierced three warning drums with her arrows and even reached the very center of the camp. If she hadn't stumbled from the roof in her weakened state, Ratfan's head would already have been separated from his body. Yet even after taking two arrows and a hammer blow, she had still dashed back into the forest, disappearing without a trace. And just like countless nights before, she would return the next night, always managing to track Ratfan no matter where he fled.<br>Exhaustion and fear had everyone on edge. Some said the girl had long since died, and that what kept returning was merely her spirit, driven by obsession. Others said she had devolved into a member of the Wild Hunt, and that only the Ratniki could stop her now.<br>But Ratfan knew the truth: she was just a little girl. He had seen Jahoda when he scouted the Seahook Gang before, and even the gang's boss had praised her highly.<br>Back then, Jahoda was a slight and ingenuous kid. When she stood below with the others, she would secretly tug at her companion's hand, swaying back and forth, only calming down after a gentle tap on the head. She had looked nothing like a thief. By any measure, she still had a long way to grow, or perhaps, she didn't even know what form she wanted to shape herself into.<br>Now Ratfan knew he had been wrong. Jahoda didn't need time to grow — she just needed a reason.<br>And he had given her that reason with his own hands.<br>—So be it, then. They would settle this in the way thieves knew best.<br>Another night, Ratfan had torches planted all around the camp, and he stood alone in the center, weapon in hand.<br>He couldn't even remember the last time he had held a weapon himself. The sword felt impossibly heavy, heavier than a bag stuffed full of Mora.<br>As expected, his opponent appeared, calmly stepping into the obvious trap.<br>The torches lit up Jahoda's face, gaunt from hunger. A lingering fever had drained all color from her skin, and her hair clung to her cheeks like withered grass. Her lips were cracked like parched earth, yet her eyes still shone, bright, sharp, and unyielding. It was as if she had struck a bargain with death itself, her soul burning with a fierce vitality that would last until her vengeance was complete.<br>Jahoda was a lone gambler, and her life was her final chip.<br>Since she had nothing to lose, why not go all in?<br>\"Kid... let's talk, alright? Whatever you want, I can give it to you, just name it.\"<br>Ratfan swallowed hard, the bravery he'd scraped together already slipping away.<br>He knew those eyes too well. They belonged to a desperate soul.<br>\"I—I know you're a good person, Jahoda...\"<br>Jahoda had nothing. But he had so much — money, jewels, gold, wealth, luxury, all waiting for him.<br>\"L—Listen to me, don't do anything reckless... we can...\"<br>But Jahoda didn't need any of it.<br>She had already sunk her teeth into her prey.",

She was covered in wounds, but at least she'd survived.<br>\"I'll pay you.\"<br>\"I don't see what else you have left to offer me.\"<br>\"I can work for you.\"<br>Jahoda brushed her hand over her empty right sleeve, then added:<br>\"Anything you need.\"<br>The ever-resourceful Lady Nefer shrugged, unfazed by Jahoda's desperate tone. Money meant nothing to her. The only reason she'd told Jahoda where to find Ratfan in the first place was to let someone else take care of a puppet that had started tugging at its strings. Even if it failed, it would still serve as a warning.<br>But to her surprise, that scrawny little hyena had actually torn out the wolf's throat. It seemed the girl she had planted as a hidden pawn was no longer of any use.<br>\"What's your next plan? Continue with your old trade as a thief? I can introduce you to a few... somewhat more reliable Treasure Hoarders.\"<br>\"...\"<br>\"Oh, that doesn't appeal to you? Then how about the Adventurers' Guild? You might just get lucky and strike it rich in some ruins.\"<br>\"...\"<br>\"Still refusing? Fine. Perhaps you want to leave Nod-Krai to heal the scars in your heart...\"<br>\"I don't need those scars healed.\"<br>Jahoda broke her silence, giving her final answer.<br>She had once loathed those ugly, aching scars, like rotting fruit sinking in a swamp or the remains left by a beast's meal.<br>Yet when fever nearly caused her to miss the ambush from her perch in the tree, it was the pain from a scar on her back that jolted her awake. And when an enemy's trap nearly caught her, the freshly healed scar on her hand reminded her not to repeat the same mistake...<br>For some lucky souls living a comfortable life, scars are nothing more than unfortunate blemishes.<br>But for Jahoda, scars bore witness to the choices she had made and the path she had forged for herself.<br>She had endured the scars, so she would endure life, just as she always had.<br>Nefer suddenly clapped her hands, cutting the conversation just as before. She had heard enough.<br>\"Alright, that's enough for today. Any longer, and you'll pass out again.\" She narrowed her eyes and smiled. \"The rest doesn't matter, but since you said you'd work for me and could do anything... I believe we have a deal.\"<br>The contract has suddenly been sealed. Still unsure of what had just happened, Jahoda hesitated, then nodded. At least she now had a place to stay.<br>\"...Yes, Miss Nefer.\"<br>\"Call me Boss.\"<br>\"Huh?\"<br>\"From now on, call me Boss Nefer.\"<br>\"Yes. Boss... Nefer.\"",

Just as she prepared to jump to the next roof, a window swung open, and a voice bellowed:<br>\"Hey! Miss Jahoda! Miss Jahoda!\"<br>Jahoda turned around in a daze, shadows from the past flashing through her mind.<br>\"You're... that swindler...\"<br>\"Ahem! Not a swindler anymore, I swear. I've long since turned over a new leaf.\"<br>The merchant waved his hands wildly, repeatedly urging Jahoda inside before hurrying to lay out sweet biscuits and tea. Jahoda glanced around; not much had changed since her last \"visit.\"<br>\"*sigh* I must thank you for what you did back then, Miss Jahoda. You were so kind to return the necklace. If I had really lost it, I don't know how I would've gotten by.\"<br>As he spoke, the merchant kept patting his chest and sighing, babbling on about how he'd cleaned up his act over the years, how he'd made a comeback, and was now doing good deeds to make up for his past.<br>Memories Jahoda had long tried to bury began to resurface. The merchant's voice faded, replaced by voices far more familiar.<br>\"B—Besides, the money's already been returned to the victims. Giving back a necklace to that swindler won't hurt! One thing at a time...\"<br>\"Boss! Ow, ow! That hurtsssow! Stop pulling my ear!\"<br>\"J—Just because we're thieves doesn't mean we always have to do bad things. You've all taken care of me for so long, haven't you...?\"<br>\"If it really doesn't work out, how about bad deeds on odd days, good deeds on even days? That way, neither side gets neglected. And on Sundays... I'll just... ah! Ouch, ouch, ouch!\"<br>\"Please, no! Boss, take me with you to the negotiation! I don't want to eat Zinaida's cooking — it tastes awful!\"<br>By the time the merchant finished his rambling and saw Jahoda off with endless thanks, evening had already fallen.<br>Pushing open the door of the Curatorium of Secrets, Jahoda stepped inside, only to have Ashru rush up first, eager to play. Even after he messed up her hair, he didn't get the usual head rubs in return.<br>\"Looks like you ran into an old friend,\" Nefer said, setting down her teacup.<br>\"Boss... you knew everything?\"<br>\"Heh, let's just say our paths happened to cross. And I happened to learn about both the good and the bad things you've done.\"<br>\"Boss, I...\"<br>\"If you're going to ask me whether your 'good' or 'bad' deeds are truly 'right' or 'wrong,' I won't answer.\"<br>Nefer stood up and closed the door of the Curatorium of Secrets. The day's work was over.<br>\"You'll have to find the answers to such questions yourself.\"<br>Jahoda slumped as if deflated. Ashru hopped onto her head, letting out a disgruntled grumble, clearly still annoyed that Jahoda hadn't played with him.<br>Nefer turned back, her gaze falling on her little employee, lying there with downcast eyes and a heavy heart.<br>Perhaps, in all of Nod-Krai, Jahoda was the one who resembled her the most.<br>Both had crossed treacherous waters alone, both had hunted foes who needed removal alone, and both had their own \"problems\" to resolve.<br>Perhaps, once each of them had found their answers...<br>The owner of the Curatorium of Secrets shook her head, cutting those thoughts off.<br>\"...Heh, leaving a little suspense for the future isn't so bad, I suppose.\"",
