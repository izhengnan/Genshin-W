As wary of him as they may initially be, all are ultimately disarmed by his smooth talking, and end up telling him everything he wants to know.<br>Depending on what they then make privy to Kaeya, their night may turn into an uncontrollable nightmare or remain one of harmless banter.<br>\"Everyone's got a secret, but not everyone knows what to do with it.\"<br>Says Kaeya, with his usual arrogant smirk.",

Don't worry yourself too much about that.\"<br>Kaeya once said these words in front of Grand Master Varka.<br>As long as everything falls into place the way he expects in the end, Kaeya doesn't care all that much about how it's done.<br>This cavalier attitude is what defines his character.<br>Not that different from Death After Noon's wild and explosive taste, one might add.<br>However, his reckless approach to things is not uncontroversial.<br>Once, in order to force a bandit leader into facing him directly, Kaeya triggered the Ruin Guard at an ancient ruin to cut his opponent off, putting his own men at risk in the process.<br>It's times like these when even Jean, who puts a lot of trust in Kaeya, finds herself shaking her head in disapproval.<br>Not that this bothers Kaeya, of course. On the contrary, he actually enjoys putting people into the difficult position of making tough decisions.<br>He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes in the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.",

I'll look into it.\" Kaeya answered, with a wry smirk on his face.",

You are our last hope.\"<br>Kaeya's father squeezed his son's lean shoulders as he spoke, seemingly looking right through Kaeya to some place far beyond.<br>On the other side of the horizon sat their distant homeland of Khaenri'ah.<br>Kaeya would never forget the look of both hope and hatred in his father's eyes as he uttered those words.",

He was Diluc's friend, supporter, and sounding board, ensuring he got through every challenge he faced smoothly.<br>They were almost like twins, knowing each other's thoughts and intentions without a word, protecting Mondstadt in both light and dark.<br>...Until that fateful day, now ingrained deep in Kaeya's memory, when the convoy that Diluc was escorting was attacked by a huge monster.<br>It was the first and only time that Kaeya failed in his duty.<br>By the time Kaeya finally reached Diluc, it was all over.<br>The power their father had used to successfully fend off the attack backfired, taking their father's life.<br>Both Kaeya and Diluc were shocked by what they had witnessed, losing the calm composure a knight should retain.<br>\"Even someone like Master Crepus would submit to such a dangerous and evil power...\"<br>Sinister thoughts flashed through Kaeya's mind, and he simply smirked:<br>\"This world is truly... fascinating.\"<br>All while their father lay dead in a pool of his own blood. It was on that night that the two sons' paths diverged.",

To set his father free from the unbearable agony, Diluc Ragnvindr took his life.<br>Kaeya was Diluc's brother by adoption and was always by his side, but on this occasion Kaeya did not partake in the final moments shared between father and son.<br>The torrential rain that set in on Mondstadt that night seemed to be a sign of the heavens' grief at the passing of Master Crepus.<br>There was a side to Kaeya that he kept hidden from the world: in truth, he was an agent of Khaenri'ah, placed in Mondstadt to serve their interests. His father had abandoned him in this strange and unknown land to fulfill this mission, and it was Master Crepus and the city of Mondstadt that had welcomed him with open arms when they found him.<br>If Khaenri'ah and Mondstadt went to war, which side should he support? To whom should he offer his assistance: his birth father, who had ruthlessly abandoned him? Or his adoptive father, who had loved him and raised him?<br>For the longest time, Kaeya had agonized over these impossible questions, caught between the opposing demands of loyalty and duty, faced with an impossible choice between truth and happiness.<br>But now, Crepus' death upset this delicate balance. He felt liberated, but also ashamed of how selfishly he was responding. As an adopted son, he should have saved Crepus, but he had arrived moments too late. As a brother, he should have shared in Diluc's grief, and yet as their father lay dying on the ground, he had hung back behind his brother, that ancient plot running through his mind.<br>Consumed by guilt, Kaeya knocked on Diluc's door. As the rain poured down, the shroud of secrecy was washed away and all lies were revealed. Kaeya had finally come clean.<br>He had anticipated Diluc's anger. The brothers drew their blades, this time pointing them at each other. Kaeya felt that this was his punishment for a lifetime of lies.<br>But as the two crossed blades, Kaeya was overcome by the sensation of great elemental power surging through him. For years, he had stayed out of the way in his brother's shadow. But now, for the first time ever, he was facing his brother as his true self.<br>Bitterly cold and brittle elemental energy burst forth from the tip of his sword to meet Diluc's searing flames head-on. The clash of crimson fire and azure ice created a sudden swirl of wind that stunned them both. This was the grim moment at which Kaeya's Vision appeared.<br>Since that day, Kaeya and Diluc have gone their separate ways. But he never discusses it, just as he never discusses the origin of his Vision.<br>Though it is a reminder of a hard-fought battle, and the prize that he earned in exchange for revealing the unadulterated truth, Kaeya sees it as a stern reminder that he must live the rest of his life under the heavy burden of lies.",

The reason was never explained in Kaeya's script.<br>Perhaps it's because the character needed a catchy name, and the director just excitedly scrawled the words, \"the Dagger Bandit.\"<br>But the small knight in front of him sat with furrowed brow, deep in thought, more serious even than when thinking about what was for dinner.<br>The boundless curiosity of children makes them always want to ask questions. Even if the endless stream of questions can be a bit annoying for adults, if their curiosity is not satisfied, they may lose that spark of curiosity, and turn into a boring adult.<br>Of all the infinite possibilities in life, becoming boring is one of the worst and most tragic outcomes, so a child's questions should always be treated with care.<br>\"Hey, that's right, why is that? You asked a great question, Klee...\" Kaeya replied with a smile.<br><br>Perhaps because he was briefly a bandit on that stage, he too had thought about lives lived that were not his own beneath the bright lights.<br>Knights live as knights do, and bandits live as bandits must.<br>Justly taking up sword and bow and standing forth to show their determination to protect, that is a knight.<br>But hiding one's blade and closing the net on their prey in the darkness, that is a bandit.<br>Different people live in different ways. A thief will not bear the blade of a knight, and a traditional knight will not sneak out a hidden dagger to hurt someone.<br>If the characters in the story don't abide by such rules, then the story has betrayed the roles dictated by fate.<br>But there is no need to give such answers to a child, and there is never just one answer to a question.<br>The daggers used by the Dagger Bandit were gifts from his friends, or symbols of his career as a virtuous bandit, or commemorated past acts of charity...<br>Let's fabricate a fairytale, and weave heroes, legends, and beautiful fantasies together, just like each time before, and give children a dream to dream.<br>He turns around and takes the dagger from the side of the costume hanging in the room:<br>\"It's actually a complicated tale, and we'll have to start from when the big bandit was just a little kid. Would you like to hear about it, Klee?\"<br>\"Are you going to tell me another story, Kaeya? I'm listening!\""
