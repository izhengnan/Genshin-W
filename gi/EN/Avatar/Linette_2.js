                "Content": "When asked who the most famous magician in the Court of Fontaine is, audiences will almost certainly think of the stylish, vibrant Lyney and his stage presence.<br>But if you were to ask after its most renowned magic assistant, people would scratch their heads and be at quite a loss to answer.<br>The adulation is not for her, after all, nor is the resounding applause directed at her skill and presence. As an assistant, she needs only misdirect the audience at opportune moments, ensuring the spotlight stays on the protagonist.<br>Whether on or offstage, Lynette habitually hides behind Lyney, in shadows that neither lights nor compliments can penetrate.<br>For an assistant, keeping a low profile is a professional matter.<br>And as for a child of the \"House\"... being cloaked in shadow is how one survives.",

                "Content": "Lynette often uses phrases like \"standby\" and \"power-saving\" to avoid unwanted trouble.<br>Now, if one were to use a term like \"idling\" to avoid work, one has an 80-90% chance of getting \"doesn't that mean you're free, then!?\" as a reply, followed by renewed haranguing.<br>But, say, if you were to very seriously proclaim yourself to be in \"standby mode\" to \"save energy,\" and combine that with a statue-like expression like Lynette's, you can stupefy the other party for a while.<br>It is through such momentary gaps that Lynette will calmly slip away, all the while wearing a most serious expression.<br>This method, of course, does not work on friends, but those who know Lynette well are more than aware of her dislike of work, and still more clear with regards to the... consequences of making her do errands.<br>Though she might spout machine-related lingo often, that is about as far as Lynette understands machines.<br>There is a saying in her home: No matter what you do, do not leave her unattended in a room with the dishwasher, the vacuum cleaner... or any machine, really.<br>Failing this, by the time a third party (usually Freminet) arrives on the scene, the machine will have suffered one of two fates:<br>One, it will have broken down, somehow — the dishwasher will foam at the mouth, the vacuum cleaner will suffer convulsions, all while Lynette stands amidst the disaster zone with an innocent expression.<br>Two, the machines are mercifully spared, but there has been no progress with the task, with Lynette cat-napping in a corner somewhere.<br>Considering that the result of any one incident is unpredictable, and neither result is desirable, Lynette has, to her relief, been relieved of all housework.<br>It is strange, however, that she is able to wreck even the simplest machines due to mishandling...<br>Yet, when onstage operating magical props, Lynette is even more focused than her brother, never having made a single mistake over the years.",

                "Content": "From a certain point of view, a \"magician's assistant\" is a contradictory sort of work.<br>The cheers and applause are for the magician, the protagonist, and similarly, the flowers and fame are not directed at the protagonist's sidekick.<br>Yet a brilliant performance cannot exist without an assistant's cooperation.<br>As the one closest to the magician onstage, the assistant knows all the magician's secrets, and in dangerous performances, the assistant's every move means life or death for the magician.<br>Onstage, the magician and assistant are like a double-sided mirror. One tends toward the light, absorbing the audience's attention. The other faces the darkness, pulling levers and strings in the rear to complete the trick — each side turns the other in endless permutations.<br>If they are to operate in harmony, the assistant's skills cannot be far behind those of the magician themselves.<br>But with such skill, how could one long be content to live in another's shadow? Thus do many assistants, once their skills are fully developed, strike out on their own — they will not forever remain the pupil.<br>When Lyney became famous, many notables took notice of Lynette's potential, believing that she could achieve greater stardom still should she become an independent act. Some even asked her to take up the role of a leading actress in their films.<br>Cat ears on young lady, who was also a magician... Even with those gimmicks alone, there was a fortune to be made!<br>Alas, these passionate entreaties fell on deaf ears, and not only would Lynette reject them... She could not even be bothered to come up with reasons for doing so, instead leaving the task of coming up with them to Lyney instead.<br>This was quite the conundrum indeed, for many of those making requests were distinguished members of society. \"Father\" had left clear instructions — they were not to be treated with contempt.<br>And if his authorship were to be discovered, any further meetings with them might turn awkward.<br>So Lyney had no choice but to write letter after letter of refusal in Lynette's manner of speech, filling each to the margins with polite and earnest words.<br>Even one as silver-tongued as Lyney found it exceeding difficult to mimic her laconic manner of speech.<br>Exhausted in hand and spirit, glancing at his sister lounging on the sofa, Lyney could not help but think — why not try it for real? He could play the assistant, no problem.<br>\"...Don't even think about it.\" Even that flicker of thought could not escape Lynette. She stretched, before flipping over to face him. \"I like being your assistant.\"",

When words are had over tea at home, she is also usually the one who makes it while others do the talking.<br>As others discuss all manner of things or engage in light and idle talk, Lynette can be found sitting at the side, holding her cup in two hands, blowing on it to cool it before drinking in small sips.<br>Her tongue is naturally sensitive, and she cannot drink tea that is too hot.<br>But to use merely warm water to make tea would be an abominable waste, and to add ice to tea, or pour the tea between two cups to cool it down... Lynette would consider such actions blasphemy.<br>Ice dilutes the thickness of the drink, and the pouring will affect its layered flavor... Only by blowing on it, puff by small puff of air at a time, may one achieve the ideal temperature, so as to neither scald nor be shorn of flavor.<br>And once this ideal temperature has been achieved, one should not also drink it all immediately.<br>Some teas have greater flavor as you near the bottom of the cup, and a wait of several minutes should be imposed after one mouthful before one may continue on and savor the next sip. That is why she always takes her time when drinking tea.<br>By the time the teapot is empty, the conversation is usually also just about over.<br>And as for the teaware on the table... That might be best left to someone else, lest she wreck the dishwasher again.",

Nor have any of these people noticed the theft — to them, it may as well have been magic.<br>And because she must maintain this razor focus while working, Lynette speaks little to conserve her energy and not divide her attention.<br>Even in her daily life, or when she is at rest, she habitually filters out all kinds of useless information...<br>That said, what information counts as useful and what counts as useless is completely up to her.<br>For example, what about machine operating and housework-related skills? Why, if one never does them, one can safely and confidently tuck them away in the back of one's mind.<br>And when caught up in teatime gossip, one merely needs to occasionally append the conversation with \"I see,\" \"Is that so,\" and \"And then...\" to ensure a smooth-running chat.<br>Economy of energy — just the way she prefers it.",

Are you and Lyney not real siblings?<br>The introverted Lynette did not know how to reply, nor could Lyney always be with her. Whenever such things would happen, she could only push her ears down, curl her tail up, and squat in a corner, by herself and beside herself with misery.<br>Only alley cats would come to comfort her, coiling around and rubbing against her ankles.<br>She could not let her brother see her like this, she knew. He already had a great many things to worry about — he did not need this kind of trivial matter on his mind as well.<br>But she could not simply pretend that nothing was wrong — to deceive the genius magician, she had to fool herself first.<br>So she hugged the cat tightly to herself, softly brushing the fur on its back. As she felt its light breath, calm slowly returned to her heart.<br>By the time the cat leapt from her arms, her face had regained its usual placid appearance.<br>Among Fontaine's nobility, there are also some novelty-seeking degenerates. During one party, a certain \"important person\" found themselves taken with Lynette's unusual appearance.<br>Over her protests, despite her struggling, the siblings' foster father stuffed her into that person's carriage without a second thought, almost as if giving away a sofa-scratching cat.<br>Why her? Why was she born with these ears?<br>In her suffocating solitude, Lynette once again covered her ears in pain, unable to hold back the bitterness repressed over long years.<br>\"Stop hiding. Cowering will get you nowhere.\" That voice shone through the darkness with the moonlight. \"Come out. The one who wished to harm you is dead.\"<br>That voice was cruel ice, and yet it had a spellbinding, comforting power also. Lynette lifted her eyes, and there she saw the person she would in later days call \"Father.\"<br>\"You have good ears. Learn to use them.\"<br>\"Father\" kneaded Lynette's ears. That touch was not gentle. Indeed, they were as cold as the moon's light.<br>And like that light, it illuminated a corner of the darkness.<br>...<br>\"When a cat's ears are folded backward, that often indicates fear or vigilance, and if they stand up and point forward, that usually indicates a good mood...\"<br>Whenever Lyney tells new members of Hotel Bouffes d'ete about the habits of ordinary cats, he will often steal a glance at his younger sister nearby.<br>Lynette's ears are straight, they face the front, and they occasionally flutter outward.<br>It has been a long time since she last folded them back.",

Yet they had not the strength to flee, and thus could only stare into her eyes anxiously.<br>Lynette said nothing, nor did she reach out to further startle them. Instead, she simply looked back at them in silence.<br>Slowly they seemed to come to the understanding that she meant them no harm, and eventually dipped their straining necks.<br>Only then did Lynette pick the box of cats up, and they laid down in silence, allowing this young lady to take them back to their new \"home.\"<br>There was some small debate amongst family members as to whether the animals should be taken in, but the usually reticent Lynette put her foot down, insisting that they stay.<br>The argument somehow managed to reach the ears of none other than \"Father,\" and she had the final word — which was that her children should cease the silly squabbling.<br>\"Those who wish to raise them, do so yourselves — but do it well. Don't make trouble for others.\"<br>After a short silence, she then added, \"And if you have not taught them how to follow the rules by the end of winter, get rid of them yourselves.\"<br>That statement put paid to the rest of the argument. As for the task of teaching the cats, it fell to Lynette.<br>Considering that Lynette was usually averse to busywork, Freminet had the automated feeding machine custom made.<br>The machine came with an internal clock and a weighing machine that could allow it to feed the kittens various foods at precise times and in fixed amounts.<br>This machine, in turn, became one of the few machines to survive Lynette's tender mercies, never breaking down across many years of service. Indeed, its inner components have remained spanking new, with only the plate beneath the food outlet showing much sign of use.<br>And this... is because Lynette has never used it properly.<br>The sort of food to add into each box, how to input feeding times and amounts... Rather than memorize that, she found it more convenient to personally prepare the cat food in a plate.<br>Moreover, if she had to leave even feeding to a machine...<br>Lynette squatted next to the Non-Automated Feeding Machine, stroking the satisfied cats' fur in silent thought.<br>...How would she be able to teach these children?",

                "Content": "When Lynette was young, she often heard stories about Visions from Lyney.<br>The protagonists of these tales seemed omnipotent, capable of summoning storms with a flick of the finger or dispelling dark haze with a puff of air.<br>Those were not meticulously prepared magic tricks, no — this was the realm of true miracles.<br>If only we had Visions too, Lynette often thought.<br>Then they could turn magic tricks into real magic. They could pull food to fill their stomachs or fire to keep themselves warm from a hat. Lyney wouldn't constantly be busy just keeping them both alive.<br>But the gods never answered her prayers. In the days that followed, she and Lyney would wander on, and after several twists and turns on the city streets and in noble mansions, they found a place to plant their feet, under the aegis of their \"Father.\"<br>Both of them knew how hard this chance was to come by, and so they endured the harsh training and supported each other through countless missions.<br>Reality had eroded their childish innocence all too early, and the dream of possessing a Vision, too, had fallen by the wayside, relegated to a long-gone past.<br>During one particular mission, they were dispatched to perform at a noble's mountain villa in order to steal incriminating evidence that their target had hidden in a study.<br>The mission itself was ordinary, and it went quite well. During their performance, the two tampered with a window in the villa. Once the show was over, they would be able to re-enter stealthily and make off with the evidence without a trace.<br>But just as they thought they had succeeded, three flares went up in the forest outside the window — a message from their \"family members\" keeping watch.<br>Three flares meant the worst-case scenario: that the Maison Gardiennage was also targeting this person, and indeed had already dispatched forces to the scene.<br>If they retreated the way they came, there was a high chance of encountering Maison personnel, and if they were exposed as having used their status as magicians to conduct their mission, not only would they be doomed, but their \"family members\" would be implicated as well.<br>The voices outside the study were growing louder — if they wished to escape as quickly and stealthily as possible, they would have to make a desperate gamble.<br>The villa retreat was built against the mountain, and outside the window was a cliff, beneath which flowed a swift river.<br>Lynette exchanged a glance with her brother, and without a word, they grasped each others' hands tightly, and leapt out the window together.<br>The rippling waves below slammed into Lyney with a terrible crash.<br>He had attempted to absorb the impact with his shoulder just as they hit, protecting his sister once again, but the shock of the collision with the water swallowed his consciousness.<br>Desperate, Lynette grabbed onto a floating piece of wood, and by sheer dint of will managed to drag her unconscious brother to shore, coughing up water as she struggled on.<br>Fighting the searing pain in her lungs, she checked his condition in a panic. He was deathly pale, his eyes squeezed shut — there was no trace of his usual vitality to be seen.<br>She hugged him tightly to prevent his temperature from dropping further, even as she surveyed her surroundings. The forest was dark and gloomy, and under cover of night the twisted trees seemed even more malevolent.<br>She called his name softly, hoping that he might stand up again with a grin, just as he would do in their prior performances. But this time, the only reply she received was his weak and fragile breathing.<br>The same loneliness and fear of that fateful night so many years ago seized her heart once again.<br>\"It's been so long, and we've been through so much — I thought I had grown beyond this!<br>Why, then, is it just like that night? Can I do nothing but wait under the protection of another? As I do nothing but tremble in the darkness?<br>No. No. It should be different. We made so many miracles by our own hands, conquered so many obstacles.<br>...I wished so dearly, so ardently, to stand behind you, supporting you, back to back, shoulder to shoulder.\"<br>The Maison personnel could be patrolling nearby. She dared not call out to their \"family members,\" nor could they stay here.<br>The only thing she could do now was grasp Lyney's hand tightly, and haul him onto her shoulders.<br>If she could not see the way forward, then she would hear it.<br>Extending her ears as much as she could, she listened intently for even the slightest wisp of wind.<br>And then, as the breeze sang through the branches and through the bushes, and brushed against her face... and it gradually painted her a blurry picture.<br>Lynette groped forward in the dark, the thorns along the path piercing her skin, staining her clothes red.<br>Slowly, the scene before her eyes became clearer. Perhaps her ears had grown used to listening to the wind, or her eyes accustomed to the darkness, but her steps grew more agile, more resolute.<br>On this stage without spotlights, in this performance without plaudits, Lynette had at last become the star.<br>As the rays of dawn lanced into the woods, Lynette carried her brother back to the rendezvous point of their \"family,\" only to encounter someone wholly unexpected — their \"Father\" had arrived, having especially made the trip in person the previous night.<br>Using the last of her strength, Lynette retrieved the sodden evidence from her bosom, but before she could hand it over, her legs gave out, taking Lyney down with her as she collapsed.<br>\"Father\" grabbed them both, allowing the incriminating information to fall to the earth and be soiled.<br>\"Sleep now. You've retrieved... a far more valuable prize.\"<br>A Vision, reflecting both the dawn sun and the twins' sleeping faces, hung at Lynette's waist, glowing silently.",
