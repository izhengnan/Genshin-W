But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.<br>For example, she almost never considers \"negotiation\" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to \"threats\" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?<br>She has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.<br>For example: Why do we need to pay for food?<br>Is there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?<br>She even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.<br>In a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.<br>Much like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.<br>Mountain Shaper once had this to say about her:<br>\"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most — she also possesses a unique character.\"<br>\"She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies.\"<br>\"It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her.\"",

If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.<br>When she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.<br>Over time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.<br>He left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.<br>At last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.<br>Her father had brought with him a secret art known as \"Fate Transference\"—<br>By making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.<br>At that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.<br>He claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...<br>But the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.<br>Her father summoned that hideous, horrifying black \"seelie\" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.<br>Stupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.<br>Crises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.<br>This creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!<br>Gripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark \"seelie,\" trembling yet resolute...<br>Several days later, an adeptus following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside — spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.<br>Taking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.<br>If not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today.",

She was merely driven by some nebulous desire:<br>To live in the house that was once hers, and to see what became of her father, lost in his obsession.<br>She learned from neighbors that he had passed away several years prior only when she got there.<br>Her childhood home had also been demolished by pawnbrokers — and thus had all the traces of her memory dissipated.<br>She did not care about the attention she was attracting, and did not answer a single one of the questions asked by those in the vicinity.<br>She simply stood there, listening to the howls that swept through the depths of her heart.<br>Was it hatred? Mania? Relief?<br>They were all there, and yet none tarried for even an instant. It was as if her heart were an old well without ripples.<br>No, like a barren well with no water upon which there might be ripples.<br>She stood there for a long time, before departing again before the astonished eyes of all.<br>Each step was slow indeed, but she never once turned back.",

The only thing she proved willing to do was to climb the mountain and watch the sea of clouds.<br>It was well, however, that she would sleep when tired, drink the dew of the mountains when thirsty, and would chew on a few stalks of Qingxin when hungry.<br>Cloud Retainer took this all in, but did not disturb the girl, instead making this comb of white jade from a sacred stone and giving it to her.<br>The adeptus said that if she ever wished to sever her ties with the mortal world and enter adeptal tutelage, she should brush her hair thrice with this comb, and it would be counted as a rite of apprenticeship.<br>Shenhe did exactly as the adeptus said without any hesitation. And something strange happened then — for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.<br>On the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.<br>When the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained.<br>...<br>Today, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.<br>Through her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:<br>The first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret.",

Hunter and hunted switched places many times, the conflict locked in stalemate...<br>As the shadow of death loomed large, the gods looked upon the extraordinary girl with favor.<br>With the bright, crystalline object falling into Shenhe's hands, the balance tipped irrevocably in her favor and the victor was decided.<br>The vivid icy light pierced through the dark like skyglow, showing the path to the future.<br>In the past, it had guided Shenhe from her miserable fate.

But seeing how their eyes sparkled, she believed that these toys must be related to some wondrous emotion.<br>Though she had not figured out just what this emotion might be, this beautiful possibility did soften her heart a little.<br><br>\"Shenhe seems very interested in toys.\" This was the conclusion Xianyun came to from observing Shenhe gazing at the toy store as if in a daze.<br>Her disciple, she knew, had lost her family when young, and had trained under her wing ever since, and thus opportunities to access toys had been few and far between.<br>Now that Shenhe had returned to live amongst humans, and she herself had taken their form to do so, she found as she grew more accustomed to the lives of mortals that Shenhe had indeed lacked many opportunities for joy compared to human children.<br>And was it not her responsibility as master and elder, she thought, to accompany her disciple for a jaunt at the toy store?<br><br><br>\"Master seems very fond of toys,\" Shenhe reflected as she and her master Xianyun, at the latter's insistence, spoke to Granny Shan for the sixth time.<br>In truth, she did not quite understand the charm of these little window decorations or firecrackers.<br>Her master would often use sigils to create various colorful birds to decorate her abode. They were more vivid and lifelike than these decorations, and lovelier by far. And as for the crackling and popping of the firecrackers, they were quite crude compared to the adeptal melodies she was used to.<br>In truth, the toys themselves had but limited appeal to her, for what she actually liked was the smiles on the children's faces as they looked upon them.<br>But her master seemed very interested indeed, asking about all manner of details regarding the toys, from the crafting methods to the tricks behind releasing firecrackers. Finally, her master asked her what sort of toys she liked.<br>She believed that her master's interest must have some meaning behind it, and so she answered honestly. Then, she looked upon her master's calm, thoughtful, but silent face.<br><br>\"Shenhe does not, in fact, like toys,\" Xianyun realized at last, after several visits to the toy stores.<br>If not, that gentle expression she saw on Shenhe's face as she stood in front of the toy store should have appeared at least once as she spoke with Granny Shan at length about the little imperfections in the latter's use of paper in window decorations, about improvements to firecracker casings to improve child safety, to the point she had completely earned the old lady's admiration.<br>What her disciple needed was perhaps not toys themselves.<br>A human's childhood and youth pass by in but the blink of an eye, and those who pass on shall never return. What, then, should she do as an elder?<br>Lantern Rite was fast approaching, and human custom dictated that festivals were a good opportunity to accept gifts. After all, had she not accepted just such from the Qixing in years prior...?<br>A gift... Yes, that might do.<br><br><br>Shenhe did not realize her master's intent until she and Ganyu had received their Lantern Rite gifts from her.<br>She had felt no sense of regret about standing in front of the toy store, but her master's kindness was surprising all the same.<br>It was at that moment, when she took the long dress from the gift box her master handed to her and caressed its smooth hem that she understood how those children felt upon seeing those toys.<br>Both she and her master had changed much upon coming to the mortal realm — perhaps the future held still more pleasant surprises of this sort.<br>Her future would be full of opportunities to make up for all the laughter lost and joy she had missed out on in the past. She would keep all the warmth she received in her heart, to melt the ice within her bones."
