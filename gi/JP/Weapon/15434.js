        "<br>The decaying Cinder City and the usurper's delirious dream collapsed together into a blaze as brilliant as the sun.<br>The scarlet-eyed hero summoned the god's fiery wrath, burning the blighted, corrupted throne to drifting ash.<br>Decades have passed since Maghan the dragon slayer drove the old ruler from the deep valleys.<br>In the villages that once worshiped the dragons, new generations have long since forgotten their ancestral oaths.<br><br>Thus, when the young priest Wagadu fulfilled Maghan's final wish...<br>And laid him to rest in a nameless grave, taking up his bow, and setting forth toward the mist-shrouded mountains...<br>He had no understanding of what the old man's dying words truly meant.<br>What was it to \"renew the covenant\"? What was it to \"restore peace\"? Wagadu had no idea.<br>He simply believed the old priest had asked him to return his cherished bow to the perilous Night Realm...<br>To soothe the wrathful spirits long abandoned since the age of ancient sacrifice.<br><br>He parted the veil of mist and climbed the threefold stone stair.<br>At the ineffable border of the shadowed realm, a vast, labyrinthine hall revealed itself. Its intricate corridors glowed softly in the flowing light.<br>Before the young priest could discern whose hand had inscribed the gilded runes, a sudden surge of fog clouded his sight.<br>Visions rose in the mist and filled his mind.<br>In a daze, countless shifting forms shimmered like iridescent light.<br>He saw a maiden with eyes of turquoise, a colossal serpent draped in starlight, and a white spider weaving the sun and moon...<br>He saw figures of black gold and white steel, a sly hare mocking a wild fox, and a coyote struggling in tar.<br>Terrified, Wagadu fell to his knees. He begged the sacred ones of the Night Realm to forgive his intrusion.<br>But when the mist finally lifted, the being that loomed above the hall and gazed down upon him was not the dead he had imagined.<br>It was a mighty dragon, its wings unfurled like a rainbow cascading across the heavens.<br><br>\"O soulless one, whose fate is bound to the stars, do not let my form fill you with fear.\"<br>\"I have long comprehended your purpose, even if your own heart remains veiled in ignorant mist.\"<br>\"The priest who named himself dragon slayer sent you to forge a covenant for the ages to come.\"<br>\"The noble blood of the ancients never stained his blade, and that sincerity speaks louder than a thousand words.\"<br>\"It matters not. Our king has long perished, and I have grown weary of tending to my kin who dwell within dreams.\"<br>\"I am willing to impart all the secret rites I know, that your tribes may prosper.\"<br>\"To let you hear the whispers of the night without giving blood to the envoy who has fallen into the underworld.\"<br>\"For this, I ask but two things in return, as price for the covenant to be sealed.\"<br>\"First, your descendants must treat the ancient people I once protected as friends and equals.\"<br>\"They must heed their counsel at all times, and never allow their oaths to become mockery like the Grand Alliance.\"<br>\"Second, your descendants must strike my name from every woven record and scroll.\"<br>\"Let no self-proclaimed sage uncover it, lest they bring ruin upon our pact through their foolish revenge.\"<br>\"You need not consider, only accept. The Wayob that shelters you was once my servant.\"<br>\"Long before your birth, she told me of this transgressive covenant.\"<br><br>Like one just awakening, unable to tell dream from reality, the dazed Wagadu nodded to signify acceptance.<br>In an instant, the gilded hall and the mighty dragon dissolved like mist from a past age.<br>Wagadu was still wondering whether the visions he had just witnessed were anything more than a fleeting dream born of fatigue...<br>When suddenly, he felt a soft, feather-like touch at his side, cold as the night wind, that made him instinctively turn around.<br>There, according to legend, stood the first Iktomisaurus, newly emerged from the Night Kingdom."
