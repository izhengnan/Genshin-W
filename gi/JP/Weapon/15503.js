But ah, how I wish to hear her sing again.\"<br>\"At least Arundolyn and Roland are alright. When she returns, this calamity should have blown over.\"<br><br>The songs in praise of the archon and tunes that recorded the battle of the two dragons were many, but all slowly became lost.<br>The song the girl loved to sing, too, changed upon her return.<br>\"The dandelions carry in the summer wind,\"<br>\"Autumn brings the fragrance of grain.\"<br>\"But no wind in any season on earth\"<br>\"Shall have you gaze upon me again.\"<br><br>And after her voice and her tears had run dry, the girl swore to use her life's flame to cleanse the world's crookedness.<br>"
