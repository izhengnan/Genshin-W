When the first Pyro Archon made a vow to his forces before the volcano,<br>He stood in the shadow of many heroes, though he had never been in these past memories.<br>When the city-sacking Sacred Lord, fallen into a haze, was beaten down by the crimson-eyed youth on the stairs before an empty throne,<br>Down he gazed, and saw the face of the one who had fallen into dark mud above the city that was set ablaze.<br><br>All that had happened in the past granted him comprehension of all words, their syllabic structures, and the meaning behind them,<br>And that also allowed him to see further and for longer into the skeins of time,<br>Until he realized that night's master had arranged for all this to be shown to him.<br>At that time, the now-grown child saw a shadow that would soon cover the whole of Natlan, and the monsters from beyond.<br>He saw the black shadow that enveloped the lonely isle, burrowing at all boundaries like a tarsal maggot, ravaging like a fire.<br>Where the dark shadow lay, the deceased and the soon-to-die alike would weep aloud.<br><br>When the dark fog was about to touch the tribes of Natlan, he could not help but cry: \"Stop!\"<br>And with his first words, he suddenly awoke, finding himself lying by a blue bonfire.<br>He saw Mahamba's eyes flash with a dim light, then the elder gave him a ceremonial staff.<br><br>From that day on, Sanhaj, who knew all things about the past,<br>Would use those ancient words to censure the fools who would make light of future dangers.<br>From that day on, Sanhaj, who knew all stories, would weave a great net of lies,<br>To turn the stacks of woven scroll into a veil, so as to hide a past that should not again be touched."
