O Traveler, you will once more have cities and subjects.\"<br>\"The nation you build will flourish and prosper, and you shall one day rule the entire High Sea.\"<br>\"You will bring to them civilization and justice, but in the end, that very justice shall be their downfall.\"<br>\"Should you still be willing to set out on that journey despite knowing its ending, I will show you the way up...\"<br><br>\"O Golden Bees who speak prophecy, is there even room for choice in fate's decree?\"<br>\"If I truly did have a chance to choose, then I would be able to change the unchangeable end of which you spoke.\"<br><br>As his words fell, the waterless hollow crumbled with a crash, the silver tree turning into a golden ship.<br>This was the first encounter between the glorious king who would later play the symphony, and the prophet Sybilla."

Once, a great vessel with forty rows of oars sailed abreast the blue waves of the dawn, spreading the gospel of civilization and progress along the ocean currents.<br>Who would believe such a thing?
