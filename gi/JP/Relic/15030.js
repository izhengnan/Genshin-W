Keep her close, and keep her safe.\"<br>\"She comes from the wisdom of the flowers and the veins of the skies, and in her is the pure essence of life.\"<br>\"Khvarena is a point in the flower's heart, a single drop of light in a sea of sweet dew.\"<br>\"Please treasure my gift, until the day when the dark abyss rises to drown all life...\"<br><br>The leaves and flowers passed the distant fable between them, and it was remembered by the fruits and seeds.<br>When the mistress of flowers had withered into dust, when the master of the desert had been led astray by a false dream,<br>When the tyrants had been buried beneath the ever-shifting dunes and their ambitions were extinguished,<br>When all that had come from the soil was returned to the golden sands, and that which had come from the flowing wind was given over to the rainforest...<br>The queen of the grass and trees watched the world change quietly, remembering her earnest covenant with those who had fallen.<br><br>\"Please protect this Khvarena for me, my companion, my friend whom I love.\"<br>\"When we are gone, the mortals shall wander, lost, like infants newly taken from their swaddling,\"<br>\"Fragile, yet sufficiently strong to conquer the wild winds, the searing flames, and their own imperfections.\"<br>\"But that which I fear is not the disasters I can predict, but rather the chaotic darkness...\"<br>\"Only the evil of this darkness and the threat of 'death' can crush the buds.\"<br><br>When the gilded sand had devoured the paradise of the past, the queen of trees and grass arose to fulfill that ancient agreement.<br>Heeding the will of the Khvarena, she created for her a beauteous form, fashioning for her a life that was lovely beyond compare—<br>That was Simurgh, the divine bird, in whose form could be seen the vivid hues of countless birds, and in whose song was the song of numerous flowers...<br>The final dream of the oasis was gathered into one body, and transformed into the pure, bright, endless sea of flowers hidden within the divine bird's body."
