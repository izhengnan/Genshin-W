                "<br>\"Where are you going, wanderer?\"<br>The roving youth was stopped by a child's shout.<br>That was a child of a Tatarasuna crafts-person, and while he was ill, his eyes were still clear.<br>The youth told the child that he was bound for Inazuma City.<br>\"But it's raining really hard right now. They say that the people who left haven't returned!\"<br>The youth opened and closed his mouth a few times... But at last could only give the child a small smile.<br>The next time he set foot upon that island, that child was nowhere to be found.<br><br>\"Where are you going, Inazuman? This boat is not for you!\"<br>The wandering young man was halted at the harbor by a boatman.<br>But before the youth could draw his blade, a man in his company stopped him.<br>The man told the mariner that the outlander youth was with him.<br>\"Ah, so he's your guest, sir? My apologies for my presumption.\"<br>The man gave the youth a coat to keep the cold out, but the youth shook his head.<br>He had no need of such things — he only wished to know what interesting things he might find on this long journey.<br><br>\"Lord Harbinger. Where are you headed?\"<br>The youth, hating chatty humans the most, gave his subordinate a backhand slap.<br>But he also loved watching expressions of terror and helplessness play across human faces,<br>And it was perhaps precisely because of this imbecilic underling's expressiveness that he had kept them around.<br>He told the groveling, quailing figure that they were headed east, for Mondstadt.<br>\"I understand! I'll get your bodyguards ready right now!\"<br>He had no need of guards, of course, but he was lazier still to barter words with cretins.<br>Donning his wanderer's hat, he headed eastward alone.<br><br>\"Child, where are you going?\"<br>Returning home, the youth was stopped at the roadside by an old woman.<br>He told her that he was going west.<br>\"To Yashiori Island, then? What business are you on?\"<br>She had said this thoughtlessly, knowing only that things had not been peaceful of late.<br>The youth thanked her for her concern with earnest smile and told her that he was bound for an appointed meeting.<br>As the boat gradually approached the shore, a lady in foreign garb could be seen standing by the shoreline,<br>And she threw a small crystal sphere at the youth from afar.<br>Catching it with ease, he lifted it up to the dying, bloodied sun."
