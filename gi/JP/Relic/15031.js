                "<br>This emblem was specially designed and given to those who had, in the past,<br>Performed feats of arms in Fontaine's defense. Insignias of this sort were largely symbols of glory,<br>But some awardees would conceal them or consign them to the water.<br><br>\"Pursue the phantoms in the dark, expel them all, and hunt them down.\"<br>Such is the origin of the name \"Marechaussee Hunter,\"<br>Credited to one Cassiodor, who would be elevated to the revered title of \"Golden Hunter,\"<br>But who saw the name as a humiliation.<br>Yet, heretics and demons are rare, but people who are driven to become heretics and demons are legion.<br>Today, the Marechaussee Phantom is more focused on investigating criminal activity than battle,<br>And has absorbed into its ranks a large number of Melusines, members of a young race.<br><br>This emblem once belonged to a Marechaussee Hunter who took part in and directed the Siege of Poisson.<br>Due to this event, he left the ranks of the Marechaussee and planned to live out the rest of his days, content with the contents of his cup.<br>It was not until an old friend requested that he, against his will, try living with others again,<br>That he tried to create a world free of dark phantoms for his son and daughter.<br>At the end, that which welcomed him was a peaceful ocean, one which removed all barriers and estrangements."

Can be used on all manner of clockwork motors.<br>These would become outmoded with the arrival of Alain Guillotin's \"new model\" clockwork meka,<br>Which have themselves ceased to be \"new\" following several hundred years of further testing.<br><br>Now, regarding Alain Guillotin,<br>Before he joined, then left the Marechaussee Phantom, before finally setting up the Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering,<br>Guillotin organized research into energy at the now-ruined Institute of Natural Philosophy.<br>It is said that he, throughout his life, was close to no one but his younger sister, who also served in the Marechaussee.<br><br>There are many legends concerning him. One of them is as follows—<br>It is said that he was able to create a thinking machine during his time at the Institute,<br>And used this machine to aid his sister in her work at the Marechaussee.<br>These statements largely come from previous colleagues of his (most of whom died fighting Elynas),<br>And since there was no physical evidence of it, it has never entered official record.<br>Once, when asked about this, he commented: \"It's a great shame. There's nothing to be said.\"<br>He never again responded to any questions or inquiries relating to the matter.<br><br>Another goes as such—<br>In his old age, he retired from the Fontaine Research Institute to his workshop, and he would see no one.<br>The research he undertook in his final years was never published,<br>And after the matter, the only things that could be found in his personal workshop were signs that something had been built.<br><br>In latter years, these legends would function similarly to that work of Coppelius's that could not be performed to completion,<br>Stoking imaginations, granting inspiration, and driving ever greater efforts."

And most commonly understood...<br>Which of them was the stronger fighter? Such were the questions people reveled in discussing.<br><br>Karl Ingold, a journalist who once knew \"Parsifal,\" had since retired,<br>And had resolved to never again take up such work, taking instead the company of explorers and their wilds, their wrecks, and their ruins.<br>But perhaps out of professional pride or an old memory, he had always treasured the pictures he took as a journalist.<br>Years later, when answering an invitation to meet old friends, sent by the Vice Director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute,<br>Upon looking upon the faces on the other side of the shutters as he took a group picture of the then-members of the Narzissenkreuz Institute,<br>He thought of how he had once passed back and forth between Poisson and the Court of Fontaine many times with such hope in his heart.<br>Those several months passed by like a dream — some would consider that too long, and others, too short.<br>He remembered his younger self, who would not give up, no matter how many people told him to escape,<br>No matter how the circumstances arose like a flood that might end everything and slowly blot out the light.<br>He remembered the many smiles he saw through the viewfinder, all their fanciful thoughts concerning the future he had heard,<br>And afterwards, the cries, sounds of fracturing and metallic clashes that sounded faintly from beyond the stone floor.<br>And as he recalled the girl who used a \"trick\" to forcibly shift herself to a dark, safe cavern,<br>Only then did the regret of not having recorded her final battle engulf his vision."
