Turning to forbidden methods, artisans forged countless fae spirits upon the bones of giant beasts.<br>Having spun fallen frostmoon light into flawless flesh and blood, they clad it to forms once frail and weak.<br>Such authority to create was once the lord of the firmament's divine prerogative, yet it was handed to mortals by the rebellious envoy,<br>Who dreamed that one day, these little creatures might create a perfect being that could merge with the world.<br><br>Within the deep galleries, which still stood intact, the first angel whispered sweet dreams of the coming dawn to her companion:<br>\"I see a time when the earthly nations will yearn no longer for heavenly mercy.\"<br>\"The cities they build will rise up to the clouds, higher even than the throne and the stars.\"<br>\"I see humans sharing the vast sky with the gods they once revered.\"<br>\"There will be no more tears, sorrow, or death, for all will be complete.\"<br><br>Yet in the end, such wild delusions and ambitions were brought down from the heavens, and with them fell deep blue crystal spikes.<br>The fae shrieked as they turned into icy silver mist, and in the space of a single night, the splendor of the golden city was ruined by frost-laden winds.<br>The traitorous envoy was stripped of both name and form, and from that moment onward, a curse fell upon her kin:<br>If they dared gaze into another's eyes, and to one alone offer the love that was meant for all,<br>Then not only would their divine beauty crumble into the wind, but their minds would fall to dust,<br>Until from the fallen one's remains a Seelie would rise, forever drifting in search of fading memories to consume."

If the laws are perfect and flawless, why fear the act of inquiry?\"<br><br>It was merely a boy of humble birth who, having somehow slipped past the watchful guards, had stepped into the chamber where the priests had convened.<br>All of their scholarly accusations he refuted in turn, their charges of heresy reduced to naught but angry, speechless glares.<br>In that silent chamber, the chief priest who wore the white-branched crown finally dismissed the guards who had rushed in.<br><br>\"O heretical speaker — if, as your eloquent words would suggest, you truly hold that grievous sin is but the delusion of mere mortals...\"<br>\"...Then let you be the one to drink from this cup of burning wrath. Go to the ashen-silver tree and plead your case before the very envoys who have cast judgment upon us.\"<br><br>And so, the previously unknown youth ventured forth into the deepest recesses of the earth, seeking answers from the first angel..."

Let us recast these absurd laws with bone, and nourish the barren north with blood.\"<br>\"Let us build a city and a tower that soars up to the clouds, that the people of the earth need weep bitter tears no longer.\"<br>\"I cast this useless crown into the dust, that all earthly nations may breathe free of their shackles.\""
