Paths are forged and shattered, waxing and waning, then waiting for fate to shuffle the deck again.<br>The books in this series analyzed multiple events regarding the Order that initiated something new during the Swarm, all to posit this possibility:<b>The Order did not wither during the ravages of the Swarm Disaster. Countless planets were bound into a single will beneath the shadow of carapace wings. The yearning for survival drove this concept to walk further along its Path.</b><br>Was the fall of Ena, then, a consequence of weakness?

The following day, a special IPC grant arrived, and the Armed Archaeologists faction promptly took over the site. After sending away the Nameless onlookers and putting a few eager interstellar looters in the ground, their survey leads to a startling conclusion: The planet now crumbling in orbit is none other than Nigul-C4, long-vanished from the astral charts. Against all odds, it had survived the fangs of Oroboros hundreds of Amber Eras ago.<br>        The Nigul tribes had always been known for being scattered and insular, subsisting on a spice monopoly and consistently rejecting overtures from the Wallbuilders. This book recounts the Nigul people's dramatic transformation under the Swarm's assault. In just four decades, they abandoned all tradition to forge a new order, uniting their disparate clans, building defenses against the Swarm, and resisting till their last breath when facing a Leviathan. Though their race did not escape their destined death, their creed lasted till our time, etched onto rocks: <i>Whatever it takes to survive...</i><br><br><br><b>\"THEY Said, We Shall Divide Everything Evenly\"</b><br>Author: Anonymous<br>Publisher: Dreamjolt Children's Literature Press<br>        A string collapsing inward endlessly... like a doughnut. The Swarms dissipated. Everything edible had been eaten. Everything usable exhausted. Heat no longer flowed. The Stii people were abandoned in a city stripped bare, a lonely island of heat-death, longing in vain for Freon-driven coolers, shades in front of department stores, and the rainbow packaging of frozen foods. And then, THEY appeared in the heat waves above the asphalt road stretching to the horizon... like a doughnut.<br>        <i>THEY said, not yet.</i><br>        So they burned the city. People walked in perfect order, setting every building aflame in tacit understanding. Black dust settled, coloring everything the same shade.<br>        <i>THEY said, not yet.</i><br>        So they burned themselves. Wildfires sank downward along the coal pits. Peat smoldered deep in the rock layers. The city sank into the planetary mantle, and they felt their skin collapsing inward toward somewhere within their chests...<br>        <i>THEY said, not yet.</i><br>        Several Amber Eras after the Swarm calamity, the Wallbuilders swept this segmentum with massive scoops, as steady and slow as bulldozers, mounted on space ships. At the location where the Stiis' planet had been, all they saw was a black hole collapsing endlessly... Calm, silent, the same within as it is without.<br><br><br><b>\"Last Laugh: Archaeology of Joke Theory\"</b><br>Author: Red-Nosed Old-Timer<br>Publisher: Fictional History Project Foundation<br>        Ten Fools arrived at an anchoring area among the stars. At Flamborghan's L2 liberation point, spacecrafts, the Swarm, and the wreckage of victims floundered in darkness. The Fools plucked a single teardrop and, from its dim glow, learned that the Actors' Gondola had once docked here, shedding tears for this graveyard, but now had long since sailed away.<br>        Before the Fools could recover from the loss of having missed their masks, the Swarm arrived. Sensing the dwindling oxygen and organic matter in the cabins, the Swarm assaulted the doors tirelessly. Starving, the Fools were forced to make a rule: Each night, everyone must tell a joke, and whoever told the dullest joke would be out. Clearly, this was no laughing matter.<br>        Ten days later, only one lucky Fool remained to witness the departure of the Swarm. The final opponent, unable to resist his joke, laughed, and the survivor claimed his own mask, layered with nine distinct faces, and received the original theory of jokes. On those ten nights in the nameless graveyard, the Elation became first touched by the Order. Those theories derived through explanation, debate, and sobbing codified the art of amusement down to every punctuation mark, the first rule of which persists to this day: <i>Never explain a joke.</i><br><br><br><i>\"If there are typos, damages, or missing pages, please contact the publisher to replace them.\"</i><br><i>\"You're always welcome to place an order!\"</i>"

Yet, they sought to replace the hymns of Harmony with their own discordant anthems, going so far as to incite a rebellion against their savior. We endured great hardship to purge their dissonance at long last, but the victory was costly. You were stripped of your physical form and condemned as a sinner by the main Family, while I, too, lost much in that great fire. I left you then to embark upon a pilgrimage to the Great One's sacred sites, never imagining that I would bear witness to the ultimate fate of those apostates.<br><br>As with all convicts, the main Family's tuning stripped them of their flesh, reducing them to longing without desire, substance without will, and faith without conviction. Their purest thoughts were partitioned and dismembered, becoming verses of song, passages of scripture, and lines of law. Then, they are all to be absorbed into the Great One's magnificent \"Primordial Divine Law,\" woven into its chanted verse and embraced by infinite overtones.<br><br>During my pilgrimage, I witnessed a visitation from the Panacoustic Theater. The stars shifted, a thousand sounds rang out as one, and a million thoughts danced in ecstasy to the aria of Constantina the singer. Yet, even as puppets, those convicts refused to spend their lives heralding the consonant chord. With their last vestiges of will, they staged a final riot. The \"Edicts\" named \"Freedom\" all shifted forward by a single beat. It was merely a single beat, but the combined will of millions of convicts, held captive and catechized by the hymn for years beyond count, introduced a fleeting, discordant note into the symphony. And I must admit... that transient dissonance moved me more profoundly than the chorus of the stars ever has.<br><br>But it was only for a moment. The strings swelled to conceal the discordant note, and in a flash, the edicts, along with the final remnants of their masters' wills, were annihilated. They had found the liberation they yearned for, and the hymn was thenceforth marked by a permanent, silent beat.<br><br>And that, perhaps, is the inherent flaw in the Path we walk.<br><br>The Family remains blissfully submerged in its paradise of cosmic harmony. Even when the thorns covering the ground pierce into their feet, they can only be moved to tears by their own boundless love in that shiver of pain. If all beliefs are truly to be accepted into the \"Primordial Divine Law,\" then these dissonant voices, now sanctioned as true notes, may have consequences far more profound than they could ever anticipate.<br><br>I'm writing to offer you a true farewell. Though we said our goodbyes upon my departure from Penacony, we both still held to the belief that we would meet again along the Path of Harmony.<br><br>I am still deeply grateful for your guidance, but I can no longer believe we will meet again."

I'm just a tourist who happened to catch a movie today.</i><br><i>Oh, you mean Glamoth's Iron Cavalry? That opening scene with the Iron Cavalry fighting the Swarm was pretty tragic. The protagonist, you know, that robot, discovers traces of the Propagation after ending up in Penacony. Yet, it still decides to help the locals fight against the Swarm Disaster. Really touching. Oh, no, I'm not a local. Like I said, I'm just a tourist.</i><br><br>Robin's Fan<br><i>I came for Miss Robin's theme song! I attended her roadshow last time, and Miss Robin strongly recommended this film. She said, sure, turning this part of history into a film might mix some fiction into it... But we need to remember first, before we understand. And someday in the future, we'll be willing to unravel the truth ourselves.</i><br><i>Indeed, if it weren't for this film, I wouldn't have known about this part of Penacony's history at all!</i><br><br>Professional Critic<br><i>The film focuses on AR-214, a Glamoth Iron Cavalry who accidentally entered Penacony during the Swarm Disaster. She confronts the agony brought by Entropy Loss Syndrome, and through helping Asdana, she rediscovers the purpose of her existence and truly gains her own name. That final scene, where she removes her mech and steps into Penacony's crowd as a true girl at last, then turning back with a smile... it was deeply moving.</i><br><i>I admit, I strongly doubt whether this is historically accurate. Yet perhaps this is the filmmaker's little indulgence. History itself could be too heavy for us to grasp in full, but at least in this story, they chose to grant that girl the gentlest ending possible...</i><br><br>An Emotional Viewer<br><i>*Sniff*... When she took off her mask, I finally realized... she was just a tender-hearted girl... Facing Penacony's misunderstandings about her, she could have just left. Instead, she silently bore the blame for bringing the Swarm Disaster, while shouldering the responsibility of saving Penacony... Thank goodness the truth finally came to light... *sniff*... Director, you owe me for these tears...</i><br><br>Hardcore History Buff<br><i>This is a work of true dedication. The attention to detail is remarkable. For instance, many believe it was the Glamoth's Iron Cavalry AR-214 who brought the Swarm Disaster. Countless films and even written records repeat this mistake. But this movie carefully drew on historical research to reveal the Swarm's true origin. And the props are so meticulously crafted, you'd almost suspect the prop team had seen actual Glamoth mechs...</i><br><i>I must say, viewers can always tell when a film is made with respect, hard work, and sincerity.</i><br><br>Uma: Alright then, that's all for our viewers interview!<br>Uma: Now, as the executive producer of <i>The Darkflame Knight Rises</i>, Mr. Reca also invited the \"assistant director\" to attend the premiere ceremony. So, were you surprised when Miss Robin first proposed a collaboration on behalf of the Oak Family? What are your thoughts on her insistence on choosing the Glamoth's Iron Cavalry as the subject?

That would be March's style.<br><br><i>*Hey!

I must document everything to maintain objectivity.<br>While heading deeper into the Grove, I faced \"Dan Feng\" again, that inescapable past of mine. I never imagined this body would retain such clear memories of those moments. Would I choose differently if given another chance? Would I still protect my companions at the cost of everything? When I asked Terravox these questions, the very ones \"Dan Feng\" once asked me, perhaps... I was interrogating myself once more.<br>Terravox's response helped cement my own conviction... No matter how many times I face these questions, my answers remain unchanged.<br><br><i>*If you asked us, the answer would definitely be... yes!*</i><br><br>I learned that {NICKNAME} had fallen into Time's memoria tide, and it was Terravox who worked with Evernight to build that memoria world... In retrospect, that demigod of Earth was so deeply attached to the land of Amphoreus. The immense maze within the memoria tide was Earth itself, with {NICKNAME} hidden somewhere inside.<br>My only option was to channel Earth's power, project my consciousness into the giant tree, and journey across Amphoreus through the history that Cerces had witnessed.<br>For the first century, I traced with my fingertips every trail we'd previously walked, questioning rivers, woodlands, city-states, and their inhabitants. I also consulted ancient stones, ore deposits, and mountain ranges, but all efforts proved fruitless.<br>In the next hundred years, I touched with my palm the ocean waves, cast my gaze towards the sky, followed schools of fish to glance into abyssal trenches, and surveyed the clouds alongside rising mists. Again, I found nothing.<br>Slowly, time eroded my initial determination, and I lost myself among the primordial rock strata. Yet, only the shared memories with {NICKNAME} could guide me to locate someone forgotten within the memoria tide. These recollections continuously emerged in my mind, rekindling my original purpose and eventually leading me to {NICKNAME}.<br>Despite the endless expanse of the memoria tide, our memories served as beacons along an endless path. I found {F#her}{M#him}, and together we reawakened March 7th.<br>I always knew that my thousand-year journey would be just a blink outside the tide. Still... that experience, which nearly obliterated my consciousness, remains harrowing. However, I can't afford to worry about that anymore.<br><br><i>*So sorry for putting everyone through all that trouble... but then again, hehe... guess I really am a girl with mysterious powers after all!*</i><br><br>As I write these words, Miss Cyrene and {NICKNAME} are on the verge of completing preparations for the \"Final Era Nova.\"<br>...And March 7th keeps badgering me to let her \"review\" this \"seriously delayed\" Trailblaze log.

I could only record the glimpses I had seen, illogical and imprecise.<br><br>A giant tree filled my entire vision, its canopy blotting out the sky. Every falling leaf turned into life. Countless creatures ran toward me, surrounding me layer by layer. Birds came to rest on my shoulders. Chimeras played at my feet, pressing close to me. I felt like a slow-moving dromas, watching over the Great Tree. Then, the tree spoke to me: \"I am dying.\" I felt it too. The Great Tree truly was about to die.<br><br>\"When I die, please bury me. But how does one bury a tree? Give me to the carpenters in that village nearby. Let them use my body to build a great ship. Then take these little ones, ride upon me, and leave this land behind.\"<br><br>I nodded in silence. The Great Tree raised its voice again and said:<br><br>\"The sun will rise and fall, won't it... Stay with me like this, and protect me for one hundred years.\"<br><br>\"For a hundred years, please keep sailing on this wooden ship, waiting for me. I promise I'll come back to see you.\"<br><br>The Great Tree never shed another leaf, nor did it fall. Yet something inside it seemed to collapse all at once. The giant tree was dead. I went to the village. After hearing my explanation, the workers began shaping the Great Tree into a great ship. With the passing of time, the wood soon began to rot, but new planks were fitted to replace the old... In the end, the ship was ready to set sail.<br><br>I invited all living beings aboard, and we drifted slowly on the water. I told myself that from this moment on, I would wait one hundred years.

That was the second... And then, I lost track of how many I had seen.<br><br>When I came to my senses, the wooden ship was already sailing beneath the stars. In the far reaches of the cosmos, I caught sight of a single star at dawn, twinkling in silence.<br><br>Only then did I realize: \"A hundred years had already passed.\"<br><br>It was just one night's dream. I once heard someone say that myths are dreamscapes shared by many, and dreamscapes are myths for one alone. What this dream was meant to reveal, I do not know. Perhaps it was merely the projection of a wish."

Their histories have all been methodically examined and enshrined in these chronicles. It was then I wished to set aside my quill, ready to seal these volumes for posterity.<br><br>Then came Light Calendar 4159. As the holy city mourned Grand Craftsman Chartonus, who fell defending Okhema, I was tasked with crafting his epitaph. In that solemn moment, a question seized me: Should our chronicles only immortalize those of Kephale's descendants? This insight drove me back to my calling with renewed purpose. I began collecting scattered histories of various peoples, beginning with the Mountain Dwellers' Dromas Riders, whose valiant deeds deserve their place in the grand mosaic of Amphorean civilization.<br><br>...<br><br><b><i>Volume 2: The Creation of the Dromas Riders</i></b><br><br>...<br><br>After Geocles the Mountainbreaker set the Campa Mountains ablaze with revolution, leading his people from their dire circumstances into the historical spotlight, internal divisions quickly appeared among the Mountain Dwellers. Some abandoned warfare for agriculture and mining, only to be enslaved by the tyrant during the Chrysos War, condemned to ceaseless toil. Others, inspired by Geocles' ambitions and committed to fight for their people's future, rallied under his banner to form an army.<br><br>The Mountain Dwellers first joined the Chrysos War in Light Calendar 3798, using their remarkable stamina and physique to seize three cities in just ten days. Their weaknesses, however, quickly surfaced: sluggish movement, slow thinking, overly cautious planning, and combat inexperience. During the Month of Mourning, amid howling snowstorms that sealed mountain passes, Usurper Oleinus sprung his trap. He lured Geocles's forces into an ambush and exploited their fear of cold water by flooding them with icy springs from above. Three hundred mountain warriors, immobilized by cold and starvation, were captured and imprisoned. By then, Mountain Dwellers had already become highly prized slaves. And in his greed, the Usurper spared even the Mountainbreaker himself from execution, a decision that would ultimately cost him both his kingdom and his life.<br><br>The dungeons contained not just the newly captured mountain elite warriors but also dozens of dromases. These earth creatures were highly coveted by merchants. The strong ones served as beasts of burden, while the weak and old became meat rations for armies. Being creations of Georios like the dromases, Mountain Dwellers naturally speak the dromas tongue. When the guards grew careless, Geocles sneaked to the enclosures and shared his plan, persuading all the dromases to join his righteous cause. After the snow melted, the Usurper ordered the prisoners transferred. As soon as the dungeon doors opened, dust clouds erupted. The Mountain Dwellers drove the dromases forward like thunderbolts, instantly crushing the Usurper and his troops into a bloody mess.<br><br>...<br><br>After overthrowing the tyrant and freeing Oleinus, the Mountain Dwellers established their base and began honing their military skills. During this period, Geocles devoted himself to studying warfare strategy day and night while training his forces, eventually forging an elite cavalry of dromas riders. Unlike their infantry, these dromas riders eliminated the problem of sluggish movement while maximizing the ferocity of the dromases. Once their charge gained momentum, none could stand against them. Though some tried setting traps, few could effectively contain dromases, and the battle-wise Geocles rarely fell for such tactics. By Light Calendar 3840, the dromas riders were feared throughout Amphoreus. From their Oleinus Plateau fortress, they proclaimed themselves defenders of earth's creatures, with no kingdom daring to challenge them. When Kremnoan forces attempted an interception, Geocles, understanding the limitations of pitched battles, smashed their front lines before swiftly withdrawing, leaving the Kremnoan troops without recourse.<br><br>..."

                "Desc": "...<br><br><b><i>Volume 4: The Walking Dragon Terravox</i></b><br><br>...<br><br>In the year 3865 of the Light Calendar, Aquila experienced unstable weather, while inland Amphoreus was struck by alternating droughts and floods. Crops failed before harvest, and the land became littered with corpses of the starved. Faced with famine, the nations turned their eyes to Earth's creations, slaughtering their kind to fill their kitchens. According to historical records, species such as the Fearfool Birds and the Audubon Pigeons, which should have thrived in the wild, were hunted to extinction within just five years.<br><br>To protect his kin, Geocles led the Dromas Legion on raids across the land again and again. With each campaign, the Mountainbreaker saw more clearly the cruelty hidden beneath the mask of civilization worn by Kephale's descendants. He once heard the dying wail of a dromas cut in half, and witnessed a chimera struggling in a boiling cauldron while the culprits stood by, mouths watering as they waited to eat. After witnessing such horrors time and again, the once-honorable hero known as the Mountainbreaker gradually became cold, violent, and vengeful toward all other races.<br><br>In the Month of Everday in Light Calendar 3868, the Dromas Legion launched an expedition to the Silo Kossas Peninsula, rescuing dromases trapped by the black tide. They crossed Idilia Bay, avoided the Kremnos Fortress, passed the eastern ridges of the Grove, and returned to the Oleinus Plateau. While traversing the Dolos Plains, they encountered a battlefield scene: a colossal dromas stood alone amid the chaos, carrying a cluster of chimeras and beasts on its back. Its form was more gigantic and imposing than that of any ordinary dromas. Armies from nearby city-states encircled it, loosing volleys of arrows in disarray. Though the arrows could not pierce its hide, the young upon its back fell one by one. In that moment, its body was soaked in red as if draped in a robe of blood, and its anguished cry shook the land.<br><br>Geocles saw this and gave the order to charge. The Dromas Legion surged like a flood, scattering enemy troops in all directions. The Mountainbreaker rushed forward, examined the great beast's wounds, and questioned the origin of the attackers. The beast gave no reply. Geocles then led the Dromas Legion in pursuit, riding straight to the gates of the city. The walls of earth and stone collapsed under the weight of the Dromas Legion like they were made of paper. In moments, half the city-state lay flattened underfoot.<br><br>Just as the Dromas Legion prepared to wipe out the last of their enemies, the giant beast rushed forward and shouted a command to stop. \"The Mountain Dwellers have never been fond of war. If this is your way, then who are you to speak for us?\" Geocles found the words absurd. \"The Dromas Legion saved you from the encirclement, and now you dare lecture me?\" The two clashed amid the broken ruins. The chieftain of the Mountain Dwellers had always claimed divine strength and often wrestled with dromases without falling behind. But this time, no matter how he pushed, the beast refused to yield. Instead, it pressed forward, driving Geocles back step by step, and then slammed into him with full force, hurling him into the city wall. Brick and stone exploded outward. The warlord was left embedded in the rock, and it took him some time before he emerged, covered in dust and grime.<br><br>...<br><br>The arrival of mighty Terravox sealed the final gap in the Dromas Legion's rise to power. In the past, the Mountain Dwellers had Geocles to lead them. Now, the dromases moved under the command of the Dromas King. The traps once crafted to counter them had become meaningless. In every battle, Terravox charged ahead, turning his power to shatter mountains and his armor resistant to blade or metal into a force that crushed all obstacles beneath his feet.<br><br>Terravox's most vital role was to cleanse the lingering violence within the army. At that time, Geocles, the first among the Mountain Dwellers to raise a banner in rebellion, led his iron cavalry across city-states. Though his cause was just, he gradually lost his mercy.<br><br>After entering the camp, Terravox rekindled the Mountain Dwellers' ancestral sense of kindness. With unmatched power, he shattered enemy lines. With unshakable authority, he put an end to needless slaughter. At first, Geocles remained wary that their enemies might seek revenge. But once he saw Terravox's disciplined command and how even the Kremnos Army could not shake the Dromas Legion, he laid down his doubts and placed his trust in him. In time, these two heroes, so different in nature, became the closest of companions.<br><br>Terravox softened the Mountainbreaker's wrath with his own gentleness, while the Mountainbreaker's hardened path also left its imprint on Terravox. The ancient dromas, who had lived apart from humankind for over five millennia, first came to understand what it meant to be accused, to witness the cruelty of human hearts, and... to face betrayal. As the one who had once defied ancestral law and fled his homeland, Geocles understood these things well. Before the Leviathan who had never broken an oath, he passed on the philosophy of betrayal and survival not with speeches, but through his every action. By then, the bond between man and beast had already become inseparable.<br><br>Over fifty years later, during the assault on Georios, the Mountainbreaker witnessed his most trusted comrade turn traitor, and the once-invincible Dromas Legion collapse like a breached dam. He refused to surrender and fell into a rocky abyss.<br><br>\"Only survival is worth blind loyalty. All else may be betrayed.\"<br><br>...<br>"

Time, it seems, rushes by even faster than raging ocean waters.<br><br>Since you've been gone, I've grown fond of bathing, perhaps because the Marmoreal Palace has gained a certain fragrance now without any swimming fish. I now understand why a certain someone loved swimming beneath the waves. The flowing waters do wash away your weariness and concerns.<br><br>Sadly, certain melodious sounds no longer grace my ears. It's your fault for always humming tunes beside me, making it impossible to appreciate other singers' performances. What a crime to deprive the demigod of Romance of enjoying the beauty of music. I wonder when you'll ever make proper amends.<br><br>Recently, though, I've detected a familiar fishy aroma in the pool. I can tell your longing as a demigod has been quietly visiting this place, hasn't it?<br><br>You obstinate fish. If you miss me so much, why not leave those desolate, dead waters and meet me again? I've perfected the divine power of Romance, and my creations now resist both ocean and blade. But I've yet to find worthy guests to wear them. Perhaps only someone with your grace could truly honor a demigod's work.<br><br>I've woven lots and lots of new garments, all hidden in my mansion's secret chamber — you know the one. Should you ever return to Okhema, be sure to claim them. These clothes weren't designed for you, but I'd rather see them burn to cinders than grace the bodies of the hideous and cruel.<br><br>Honestly, I don't know if you'll ever see this letter. The previous forty-nine received no response. Perhaps I'm using the wrong delivery method?<br><br>Your priest claimed that sinking a teleslate into Styxia's depths would allow their demigod to sense it. Perhaps I should follow the Imperator's example and sentence that priest to the depths for deceiving royalty, offering her to you and your fish.

So, I'll spare her life.<br><br>I must confess, even as the curse erodes my emotions, I cannot match the Imperator's decisiveness in permanently silencing defiant subjects. I still sense people's anguish during catastrophes through the golden threads and feel the sorrow flowing through their hearts. The guests from beyond the sky mentioned this compassion had once trapped another version of me in misfortune, which both troubles and pleases me. Even after a thousand years, I could never become another Imperator, nor a cold divine statue.<br><br>Today, both the military and civilians scrutinize my every move. Their collective gaze upon a leader burns more intensely than even that upon a demigod, and I can barely escape its scorching heat. Only in my private bath, before my teacher's smile, and in these letters to you — which may never be read — can I remove the burden of my position and breathe freely, if only briefly.<br><br>At times, the golden threads capture the tremors of destiny, whispering to me about the end of fate. That end that now draws near. Though bound by the shackles of Law, the Theoros wields power far beyond any Titan. Over the past five decades, as his strength has waxed, ours has waned. A great battle approaches, and with it, a great defeat.<br><br>Yet I remain hopeful, for that Priest of Time brought promises: She and those who come after her will shoulder the burdens to come. Heroes fighting to their last breath will hold back the tide of misfortune.

I found it quite embarrassing at first, but after descending into the nether realm and enduring the long passage of time, I've begun to envy the version of myself who will eventually meet you, and started hoping that silly little \"debt\" might actually get paid after all.<br><br>Oh, forgive me for my sentimentality.<br><br>The nether realm is more beautiful than I imagined, yet also more desolate. I've reunited with my sister Polyxia here, alongside countless faces both known and unknown, like the hundreds of heroes lost during the first Flame-Chase, their minds fragmented yet their insignias still brilliantly shining. Or Lady Aglaea, who gifted me a nymph companion before silently fading into the flower fields...<br><br>Not long after, Lady Tribbie depleted her divine power to create a passage between Styxia and the Vortex of Genesis, which Hysilens maintained with her power. Before departing, Tribbie entrusted me with guarding this passage. And over countless years, I witnessed from the nether realm as my companions perished one after another, some never even managing reaching here, such as... Mydei, who shattered his soul into five pieces, or Professor Anaxa, who transmuted himself into a Philosopher's Stone.<br><br>Finally, when not a single human being remained alive in Amphoreus, Hysilens had to concentrate all her divine power within Styxia's revelry to seal Lygus. Without the Ocean's power, the passage connecting Styxia to the Vortex of Genesis began disintegrating. And then, I made my final decision: to assume the form of Netherwing's corpse and command the waters of the River of Souls to preserve that passage.<br><br>Before becoming Netherwing, I racked my mind thinking what I might leave for you. But I could hardly expect to receive anyone's embrace as Netherwing.<br><br>In a flash of recollection, I remembered Miss Cyrene once secretly told me that you had wished for me to send you a \"nether postcard\" from the underworld in the previous recurrence. So, while my body can still hold a pen, I've written this letter for you and instructed the flourishing Antila flowers to carry it from the nether realm, waiting for you to find it.<br><br>Someday, when you travel that passage to the Vortex of Genesis, perhaps you'll discover this \"nether postcard\" among the Antila flowers. Or perhaps by then I will have expended all my power and fallen into deep slumber, with all the Antila flowers long withered...<br><br>But this is certainly not our last goodbye. Should you fulfill your destiny as the Deliverer, then in that bright new world, I promise I'll find the courage to ask you for...<br><br>...an embrace I've waited for millennia too long.<br><br>Castorice"

Because I'm a scholar, and I'm happy right now. Everything logically makes sense.<br>And no, I'm not drunk. Not at all.<br><br>By Flavor<br>- Grape (Original honey brew)<br>A favorite of those Skyfolk. I figure they insist on pure honey brew because there's no such thing in the sky to begin with.<br>After asking around, it turns out plenty of folks are still loyal to the original taste. There sure are a lot of old-schoolers.<br><br>- Pomegranate (Sanguine honey brew)<br>A well-known fact: A honey brew of pomegranate flavor contains zero grapes.<br>Another fact everyone knows: If someone claims to prefer pomegranate honey brew, especially those who use the word \"nostalgia,\" don't mess with them. You probably don't stand a chance fighting against them.<br><br>- Wheat (Chrysos honey brew)<br>\"None of us can taste Celestial Ambrosia or the Dew of Divine Blood, but that heroic golden color still makes everyone crave a sip.<br>Chrysos honey brew is a very popular flavor, representing people's hopes for the future.\"<br>Ahahaha. The above is total advertising nonsense. But I actually like this flavor too.<br><br>...<br><br>- Mint (Herbal honey brew)<br>In all of Amphoreus, only those from the Grove would order this kind of honey brew. Its flavor is as offensive as their research topics.<br>They love to argue and question everything until they've unveiled everything. But when trouble comes knocking? They're exactly who you need.<br>Shame that hardly anyone orders this anymore since that sharp-tongued professor chose to become stone.<br><br>Just Give Me Anything (<s>Awful</s>)<br>These people came to talk. They don't like honey brew at all. Feel free to kick them out. The great Phagousa would shower you with praise.<br><br><br><br>By Concentration<br>Why did I even start this section? The concentration of Phagousa's honey brews is all randomized, and Lady Hysilens hasn't changed that tradition. But since I've begun, I might as well finish it.<br>The randomness means I never judge someone based on which strength they prefer.<br><br>- Very Light (Below 10% Intoxication)<br><s>Only absolute cowards drink this watery trash of a honey brew!!!</s> Gentle on the palate and universally adored. When the Ocean's power threatens to erupt from your stomach up to your mouth, everyone prays their next bottle is of this strength.<br>Those who stand by this concentration are typically welcoming, <s>like total pushovers</s> like those <s>outworlders</s> newly enlisted soldiers. Though ironically, they're all over a thousand years old now.<br><br>- Light (10% to 20% Intoxication)<br>Ah, my personal favorite! Wanna know how fans of this strength are like? Just look at me! Cheerful, full of curiosity, perfect long-term companion material, with occasional mood swings as our only drawback.<br>I especially recommend it with cotton flavor.<br><br>- Medium (20% to 35% Intoxication)<br>Fans of this strength are, simply put, your average people. Nothing makes them happier than huddling together and knocking back drink after drink.<br>\"*gulp* Ahh... this brew has the perfect punch. All praise to Phagousa!\"<br>Thinking about it, those two inseparable dukes also prefer this strength. I can never get those Dux titles right.<br><br>- Strong (30% to 50% Intoxication)<br>I don't get it, and I don't want to.<br><br>- Very Strong (Above 50% Intoxication)<br>Oh, Dux Goldweaver, I just miss your masterful skills.<br>Folks who favor this strength have typically either racked up impressive battlefield achievements or bear significant scars — mental or physical.<br>Or perhaps they were simply born with exceptional resilience. I recommend making friends with these folks. The stories they tell could drown me.<br><br>- Sober Brew (Non-intoxicating beverage that replicates the flavor only)<br>I nearly forgot about this.<br>Legend tells that long ago, a honey brew manager crafted this specially for the child hostage Holy Maiden, only to discover the whole thing was a misunderstanding.<br>They planned to seal it away forever, but someone discovered it and repurposed it as a honey brew substitute. Can't exactly march into battle intoxicated, can you?<br>It's all gone now. Production was already limited, and a cat somehow consumed the entire stock before our revelry began.<br>I really wish I could have tried it.<br><br><br>Afterword<br>Goodness! By Hysilens above, I've spent six hours and three quints on this tablet journal, and I'm completely sober now.<br>What absolute drivel have I written here?<br>Ah, well, since everyone's drunk, and the revelry never ends, nobody will care about my scribblings. I'll just leave this here for entertainment.<br>Oh Hysilens above, what utter gibberish have I recorded? I need another bottle immediately. I'm done here."

Now, one battle barely ends before the next begins. You're working yourself too hard.<br><br>The Month of Everday is almost upon us, and the annual Sky Rite will soon begin. Little Halkos has just turned eight and is eagerly readying himself for the rite. Sometimes, I see flashes of your younger self in him. Like you, he's growing up surrounded by the heroic legends of Lady Seliose, sharing your diligence and work ethic. Yet while our family's hardships taught you life's cruel uncertainties and perhaps made you too resolute, your protection ensures that little Halkos... and the other stray children recently welcomed into our courtyard, need not face the same bitter lessons.<br><br>The evening before I wrote this letter, little Halkos fell asleep to tales of your adventures. Just before his eyes closed, he leaned close and whispered that unlike Lady Seliose who dwells in distant clouds, you are more like the sky itself, watching over all. I couldn't sleep that night. With my mind returning to those desperate times our tribe faced over a decade ago, my heart is filled with guilt and regret. I remember us going five days without a meal, and how wandering soldiers would claim our friends. Back then, as you listened to stories of the sky hero, you would whisper, \"I will return to the sky, and become it.\"<br><br>Oh, you were always a headstrong girl, never blessed with a priest's intuition or a warrior's instinct. What you had was simply a heart that refused to bow to destiny. I can't count the scars that earned you your current strength and standing, scars you've likely forgotten. The whole world knows how demanding service to the Imperator can be, yet every letter you send has your penman conceal your weariness, filling the page with only cheer and kindness... Seneca, your iron will isn't a weakness, but it isn't always a strength either. The burden it places on you... Is this why honey brew has become your only comfort?<br><br>Well, look at me going on and on. Write back to the courtyard soon, won't you? Everyone misses you. And really, you ought to learn to write your own letters. Always having Verginia pen them for you must be terribly inconvenient for the poor girl.<br><br>Serva, Twilight Courtyard"

Not the gentle whisper of waves or festive sounds, but a deep, distant melody that seemed to rise from the ocean depths. The priests claim it's merely the wind's voice, but I know, Phagousa is calling to me.<br><br>Tomorrow I shall travel to the Warbling Shores, closer to the music's source.<br><br>Page 2<br>I've been in Styxia for two days now.<br>At night, while others immerse themselves in drunken reverie, I visit the shore alone. The music sounds clearer here than in Okhema, like a sorrowful narrative poetry telling forgotten histories and unkept promises.<br><br>I asked local fishermen, who confirmed an ancient temple exists underwater, but no one can reach it. They say those who aren't Phagousa's devoted followers will be driven mad if they hear the underwater music, jumping into the sea and never to return. They warned me against pursuing that sound.<br><br>But they don't understand, the music brings me not madness, but revelation.<br><br>Page 5<br>I visited the temple today. The High Priest, seemingly aware of my intention, gave me a special brew, saying it would allow me to breathe underwater. She warned that if I was determined to journey to the ocean floor, I must accept that it's a one-way path from which there is no return.<br><br>\"Phagousa's song calls to those with the most sensitive spirits,\" the priest said. \"There, you will witness eternity.\"<br><br>I'm ready. I'll take this journal with me to record my experiences until the end of this path.<br><br>Wait, can a journal breathe underwater? No... I mean, is it waterproof? I'll check with the priest tomorrow.<br><br>Page 8<br>I drank the brew, and my journal, having been treated, now becomes waterproof. The liquid had a strange taste. After drinking it, I felt a sharp pain in my stomach, followed by an unusual sense of comfort.<br><br>I jumped into the water and found out I could actually breathe like a fish.<br><br>The underwater world is more magnificent than I imagined. Strange sea creatures swim around me, completely indifferent to my presence, as if I belonged among them. The light creates curious patterns in the water, like invisible guidance, and the music grows increasingly clear.<br><br>I begin to descend, moving toward the music's source.<br><br>Page 15<br>I've completely lost track of time. I can't tell which quint it is, or even which day. Underwater, light changes in ways completely different from the surface world.<br><br>I've discovered the entrance, a massive underwater archway adorned with carvings of Phagousa and her Titankins. Beyond lies a long corridor leading deeper. The corridor walls are covered with runes and murals telling the sea sirens' story. I see depictions of Helektra leaping into the chalice and images of Phagousa's tears mingling with the black tide.<br><br>The music now sounds perfectly clear, guiding me forward.<br><br>Page 20<br>It feels like an eternity has passed, as if seawater has seeped from my ears into my mind. I try to drain the water, but that makes no sense since I'm surrounded by water. How can I possibly clear my ears here?<br><br>I've lost all sense of time. I just keep swimming and swimming... After passing through countless corridors, I've finally reached a magnificent domed hall. The scene is incredible: Water currents suspended in midair forming elegant curves, massive chandeliers of shells and coral emitting soft light, circular seats filled with audiences — humans, sea sirens, and creatures I cannot identify. All completely motionless, like statues.<br><br>In the hall's center, on a circular stage, hang several water curtains. Though my vision is obscured, I glimpse what seems to be a woman's figure. Is she... holding a violin? Or seated in a chair? I can't tell... All I know for certain is that she's playing that sorrowful melody that's been calling to me. I stand motionless at the doorway, afraid to break the spell, just silently listening to her music.<br><br>Page ??<br>I've stayed to witness the ceremony, since the performance continues without end.<br><br>Endless memories dwell within the music. As the melody flows, ancient visions unfold before me: sea sirens binding themselves to Phagousa, the black tide's first devastating invasion, Helektra plunging into the sacred chalice, the underwater kingdom falling to betrayal and destruction...<br><br>More than simple melody, this is time crystallized, a history refusing to fade into oblivion.<br><br>From my front-row seat, something unexpected happens. My form also begins to crystallize, integrating into this eternal moment. While my limbs stiffen, my thoughts sharpen with unprecedented clarity.<br><br>And the truth dawns on me.<br><br>Everyone around me, we are all pilgrims drawn by the music, now eternal witnesses to history, frozen in time.<br>But I embrace this destiny without regret. In this place, time loses all meaning. Joy and sorrow dissolve into perfect, endless calm. Here I'll remain, forever listening to this final melody, awaiting the true guardian who can break our endless cycle.<br><br>This may well be my final entry. If anyone finds these pages, know that deep beneath the waves exists an eternal performer with her audience, all waiting for prophecies to be fulfilled and promises that time will never honor.<br><br>O Phagousa, will anyone hear our prayers? Will someone bring us release? Or are we destined to wait forever in this frozen moment?<br><br><i>(The remaining pages have been damaged by seawater, but one line remains visible on the final page)</i><br><br><b>I see a light, there, in the distance.

The sea appears as a mesmerizing blend of honey and sapphire, sparkling brilliantly in the sunlight. I'm grateful I accepted the High Priest's invitation to assist with the temple rituals.<br><br>Accommodations have been arranged perfectly, right by the seashore! Every night I hear waves breaking against the shore, sounding like Phagousa's whispers in my ears. The full moon ceremony will be held tomorrow, and I hope to receive the Ocean Titan's blessing.<br><br>Month of Joy, Day 5<br>It's late, but I must record everything I saw today. The full moon ceremony far exceeded my expectations! The High Priest had mentioned that rituals in Styxia differ from those in Okhema with fewer rules and more fervor, and this proved absolutely true.<br><br>As night fell, hundreds of lights illuminated the sea of honey brew hues. People placed specially crafted lanterns in the water, which currents carried toward the deep ocean. They say these lights guide Phagousa's gaze, allowing her to witness our devotion.<br><br>People began drinking, not in small sips but great gulps! The honey brew shimmered with a golden glow and burned like fire down the throat. I drank some too, and then... everything felt like a blur. I remember jumping into the sea, dancing in the shallows with everyone. I recall seeing humans dancing with sea creatures, and for a brief moment, I thought I saw sea sirens! Perhaps it was just the brew's effects.<br><br>I have a vague recollection of strange music from the distant sea, a sound blending harp notes with ocean waves. The melody was bewitching yet carried a hint of sorrow, as if calling out to something.<br><br>Month of Joy, Day 9<br>The sea today is remarkably calm, a perfect mirror reflecting the sky above. The High Priest says this is a positive omen, that Phagousa is watching over us.<br><br>I heard that mysterious music again last night, more distinctly this time. No one could explain what it was, they're all too absorbed in their festivities. The melody seemed to tell a story of loneliness and betrayal. I found myself strangely drawn to it, almost wanting to dive underwater to seek its source.<br><br>Duties at the temple are simple, mainly preparing offerings and brewing sacred water. The High Priest taught me how to transform ordinary seawater into \"Tears of Phagousa\" — special holy water said to heal spiritual wounds. She warned me never to taste it, saying, \"It is not meant for mortal lips.\"<br><br>Month of Everday, Day 1<br>Something changed today. People report seeing \"ripples\" on the sea — not ordinary waves, but disturbances, as though... the surface of the water had been mutilated by something.<br><br>People in the streets seem increasingly frenzied, with taverns operating all day and night. When I asked the High Priest if this was normal, she just smiled and said Phagousa's followers always become more active during the Month of Everday. But I sense there's more than meets the eye.<br><br>Tonight, the music sounds clearer than ever before. I believe it must be Hysilens, the legendary Chrysos Heir songstress. Ancient tales say she was once a sea siren who now plays alone in the ocean depths, waiting for her departed companions to return. The profound sorrow in that music is almost suffocating.<br><br>Month of Everday, Day 7<br>I've started sleepwalking today... I woke to myself standing at the beach, clothes drenched, with salt water on my lips. More disturbing still, I remember my dream. I followed that haunting music into the sea and discovered a... stage?<br>It was an underwater stage surrounded by seated figures, all motionless as if frozen in time. At the center stood a woman with a harp, playing that mournful melody. She turned to me and spoke, but I couldn't hear her words. Then I awoke with a start.<br><br>People in the city grow fewer each day. Not because they're leaving, but because they're... vanishing. They joined the nightly celebrations and never returned. When I asked the High Priest about this, she simply said they had \"returned to Phagousa's embrace.\"<br><br>Strangely, I'm reminded of an old nursery rhyme:<br>\"Phagousa's chalice filled with tears of old. Those who drink see home, but nevermore return.\"<br><br>Month of Freedom, Day 4<br>The city's celebrations have reached the peak of their feverish intensity. People have stopped working and thinking. They only drink, dance, and seek pleasure, as if tomorrow were the last day of the world.<br><br>Today I ventured underwater, seeking the music's source. The submerged world was breathtaking. I discovered ancient structures, seemingly the ruins of an underwater city. This must be the dwelling of the sea sirens that legends speak of, the place of eternal celebration Phagousa promised them. Now only ruins remain, accompanied by that solitary, mournful song.<br><br>Month of Strife, Day 1<br>I've decided to leave Styxia. The madness here has become unbearable. The people are changing into something less human and more like...<br><br>Before leaving, the High Priest gave me a small vial containing a glowing liquid.<br>\"It's the Siren's Tear.\" she said. \"If you hear the song calling to you, drink this. You'll discover the truth you seek.\"<br><br>I don't know if I'll ever find the courage to drink it. But I know that as long as Hysilens continues to sing, Phagousa's legacy lives on. Perhaps someday the world will find balance again, and the Chalice of Plenty will overflow not with tears, but with joy.<br><br>This is my final journal entry from Styxia. May Phagousa bless all who drink, and may Hysilens' melody guide lost souls home."

And in turn, forged that power into a blade that knew no equal.<br><br>It was in Okhema that she sparked a new era, where the edge of her sword no longer pointed at the Flame-Chasing frontiers, but toward the horizon cradling the dawn.<br><br>...<br><br>From her first emergence in Light Calendar 3851 to the capture of Janusopolis in 3960, the Imperator launched more than twenty campaigns and personally led over eighty critical battles. Her defeats were so rare they could be counted on a single hand. An awe-inspiring record. Among them, ten battles stand out for their far-reaching historical impact, encapsulating the Imperator's military doctrine and her mastery of warfare. The following pages recount these battles, to honor her legacy, and to serve as a beacon for those who will lead armies in the future.<br><br><b>During the War for the Crown</b><br><br>From Light Calendar 3851 to 3910, the Imperator rose from an obscure leader to gathering talents from every corner, expanding her forces, laying siege to strongholds, and tightening her grip on military might. History would see her ascend to the very apex of authority not only in Okhema, but across all of Amphoreus. This decades-long military career, for clarity and to distinguish it from the Flame-Chase Journey, is referred to herein as the War for the Crown.<br><br>...<br><br><u>1. The Liberation of Loukas</u><br>Time: Light Calendar 3851. Location: Loukas Plains. Key General: Cerydra<br><br>Before the Liberation of Loukas, the world knew only that Hyperborea had a young princess, but knew not the name of Cerydra. Early in 3850, Okhema's spies in the northern territories reported that Hyperborea was faltering as a country, its people in despair. The royal court had emptied its treasury to raise a host of mercenaries, intending to send with the princess southward to launch an assault on the holy city. Okhema braced for impact, stationing forces at two major choke points. But the Hyperborean army never came.<br><br>Meanwhile, in the northeastern reaches of Amphoreus, the land of Loukas was gripped by a sweeping rebellion. The uprising sought to overthrow the brutal tyrant and reclaim freedom for its people. But the tyrant's enforcer, a ruthless golden-blooded general named Fortunado, led 50,000 elite troops and crushed the rebels like waves swallowing sparks. As the resistance was driven onto a peninsula with no escape, an elite force descended upon the battlefield from the west. A young girl, calling herself the Imperator, led the charge and came to set Loukas free.<br><br>At the time, the Imperator's forces numbered barely 20,000. After two brutal clashes with Fortunado's army, her left flank exposed a fatal weakness. Sensing his moment, Fortunado personally led his superior forces in a direct assault on her exposed flank, unaware it was a trap designed to lure him away from his main formation. Three thousand hidden troops surged from Fortunado's rear like a storm from the heavens, raining fire-tipped arrows to throw his ranks into chaos. The Imperator's right wing seized the breach, coordinating a lethal thrust that split the Loukas army at its core. Thus, victory followed like a falling banner.<br><br>After the battle, Fortunado was captured and beheaded without delay. The tyrant of Loukas escaped by sea to Hattusili, a small kingdom southeast of Styxia, while the rebel forces throughout the land rallied under the Imperator's banner. Back then, no one in Amphoreus suspected that the Imperator was actually Hyperborea's puppet princess. Who would believe a young woman would dare lead an army across the Epos mountains from Hyperborea to Loukas, just to gamble on gaining her first troops?<br><br>...<br><br><u>2. The First Siege of Okhema</u><br>Time: Light Calendar 3867. Location: Okhema. Key Generals: Cerydra, Hysilens<br><br>In Light Calendar 3867, malicious plots led to the unjust execution of three Okhema generals. The military descended into chaos outside the walls while panic spread among citizens within. The tyrant of Loukas, leading combined forces from Icaria and Corinth, raided the holy city. Their ranks included formidable Chrysos Heirs who breached five defensive positions effortlessly. Even the typically honorable Kremnoan army couldn't resist the opportunity, their mobile fortresses positioned nearby like predators watching wounded prey. The holy city's fate hung by a thread.<br><br>The most dramatic event unfolded at this pivotal moment — The tyrant of Loukas's worst nightmare returned. A strike force entered the city from the west, led by a young woman who introduced herself as Cerydra. Unlike their encounter more than a decade before, the Imperator now commanded tremendous respect throughout Amphoreus with legendary generals at her command: \"Dux Fragoris\" Labienus, \"Dux Brumalis\" Seneca, and most formidable of all, \"Dux Gladiorum\" Hysilens. Hysilens created bloody tides through enemy formations with just a single sword while softly humming the funeral march.<br><br>The siege of the holy city ended in just half a day. The Loukas and Icaria tyrants fell into captivity, while the Corinth tyrant fled with his battered forces south of the Dolos plains. From her vantage in the majestic Marmoreal Palace, the Imperator surveyed the mountains of fallen soldiers and rivers of blood in the city below, and whispered words that would echo through history:<br><br>\"I came. I saw. I conquered.\"<br><br>...<br><br><u>3. The Campa Expedition</u><br>Time: Light Calendar 3874. Location: Campa Mountains. Key General: Seneca<br><br>Around Light Calendar 3865, Aquila's unpredictable climate threw Amphoreus into chaos, with alternating floods and droughts devastating harvests continent-wide. While most nations watched their power diminish, the Imperator, having heeded Tribios's prophecies, was fully prepared. She expanded her control over the territories surrounding Okhema in those years, intending to establish her authority throughout Amphoreus. Soon, all states pledged fealty to her except the proud Castrum Kremnos and Skyfolk, leaving the Imperator of the Marmoreal Palace without equal in power or prestige.<br><br>In Light Calendar 3870, Seliose slayed Aquila, causing the last sky fortress to vanish into the clouds and marking the Skyfolk's decline. Without their main adversary, Castrum Kremnos turned its blade to Okhema, forcing the Imperator to concentrate on this threat, which weakened her control over other regions. By Light Calendar 3874, Campa, relying on its remote location and the Campa Mountains as its stronghold, openly rebelled against the Okhema Alliance. Watching other states grow increasingly restless, the Imperator kept resisting the Kremnoans while secretly sending \"Dux Brumalis\" Seneca with 30,000 elite troops into the Campa Mountains. Okhema had already formed a secret alliance with Ladon, Campa's ancient enemy. With Ladonian guides who knew the terrain intimately, the mountain barriers that the Campanians considered impregnable proved no more substantial than paper walls.<br><br>In just one night, Dux Brumalis, unfazed by the bitter northern cold, captured the Campanian capital with her forces. That same evening, the Ladonian leader predictably turned traitor, only to be immediately subdued by the well-prepared Dux Brumalis. The Imperator had foreseen that the Ladonians, fearing they would be next to fall, would inevitably betray their temporary allies after victory. She had planned for this treachery from the start, eliminating two threats with a single move.<br><br>...<br><br><u>4. The Great Battle of Tretos Plains</u><br>Time: Light Calendar 3903. Location: Tretos Plains. Key General: Labienus<br><br>The war between Okhema and the Kremnoans stretched on without end. Though the Imperator was a master tactician, military strategy had its limits. The Kremnoans, with their exceptional individual fighting skills and remarkable cohesion, bolstered by virtually invulnerable Titankin shock troops, often lost smaller engagements to clever tactics yet successfully kept Okhema's forces from making meaningful advances in the war itself.<br><br>By Light Calendar 3903, after dozens of battles large and small, the main armies of Okhema and Castrum Kremnos finally clashed on the Tretos Plains. This would be the decisive confrontation between these powers, a battle where tactics meant little and retreat was unthinkable. The Tretos Plains held historic significance as the lion-hunting grounds of Gorgo, founder of Castrum Kremnos. If Okhema's forces faltered here, Kremnoan morale would surge, potentially allowing them to march directly to Okhema's gates. The Imperator took the field personally, raising her crown to inspire her troops and marking their armor with fiery emblems of courage.<br><br>The Great Battle of Tretos Plains raged for three full months. Throughout this period, the Imperator maintained defensive positions while dispatching \"Dux Fragoris\" Labienus to attack the Kremnoan command at any cost, and succeeded brilliantly. Sacrificing a hundred warriors and suffering multiple wounds himself, he disrupted the Kremnoan command structure for just half a quint. In that brief window, the Imperator identified a tiny weakness in the Kremnoan formation that ultimately decided the outcome. She later described this as the most treacherous battle of her life, but its impact proved far-reaching. The Kremnoans, their military might severely diminish, suffered three consecutive defeats afterward. They were forced to swear by Nikador's honor to a fifty-year peace treaty with Okhema, giving the Imperator invaluable time to fully consolidate her authority.<br><br>...<br><br><u>5. The Second Siege of Okhema</u><br>Time: Light Calendar 3910. Location: Okhema. Key Generals: Cerydra, Hysilens, Labienus, Seneca<br><br>After the First Siege of Okhema, the Imperator had not yet secured absolute control over Okhema's governance. Some Council Elders, seeing which way the wind blew, pledged false loyalty while harboring treacherous intentions. To temporarily stabilize the political landscape, the Imperator allowed these seemingly loyal Elders to retain some authority. However, these Elders members had long been plotting rebellion, secretly training private armies in Dawncloud while establishing connections with Okhema's enemies abroad. Finally, in Light Calendar 3910, they joined forces with resurgent Corinthian armies to launch a coup, coordinating internal and external forces to try driving the Imperator in Marmoreal Palace into a corner.<br><br>Faced with this crisis, the Imperator revealed her foresight. For decades, she had gathered craftsmen from various city-states and displaced Mountain Dwellers, providing them with homes and workshops in the Marmoreal Market. While publicly presented as social welfare, her true intentions were strategic. When the Council of Elders remnants launched their coup, the Imperator issued a single command, and thousands of craftsmen worked through the night to construct two massive walls — one trapping the Elders' army in Dawncloud, the other blocking the Corinthian forces outside the city. This brilliant tactic of besieging her would-be besiegers became known as the Second Siege of Okhema.<br><br>After just one month under siege, the Council army broke and surrendered. This time, the Imperator showed no mercy. She executed all the Elders and their families, disposing of their bodies in a lake, thus completely eliminating all threats to her authority. She then turned her attention to the Corinthian forces who, growing frustrated after their long, unsuccessful siege, were becoming restless. First, she sent Labienus and Seneca to cut off their supply lines, then ordered Hysilens to launch a surprise attack against the Corinthian capital.<br><br>Soon after, news reached Okhema that the Corinthian tyrant had taken his own life by jumping from a window. With their leader dead, the Corinthian army lost all will to fight and surrendered without resistance.<br><br>The Second Siege of Okhema cemented the Imperator's absolute control over the city. From this point forward, her ambitions faced no opposition, whether she aspired to rule all city-states, wage war against the Titans, or even... to conquer worlds beyond their own.<br><br>...<br><br>"

                "Desc": "...<br><br><b>II: The Flame-Chase Journey Era</b><br><br>After the Second Siege of Okhema, the Imperator seized absolute control of the city and officially set her ambitions in motion. Ever since Tribios spread the prophecy of salvation, the Imperator had been plotting a crusade against the Titans to claim the Coreflames. The Daythunder Knight Seliose proved that humans could kill a Titan by force. The peace treaty with Kremnos and the submission of the allied nations cleared the path ahead for the Imperator. Over the previous fifty years, some brave souls, inspired by the prophecy, also set out in pursuit of the Coreflames, but none made a mark. Then, at the end of Light Calendar 3910, the Imperator's grand Flame-Chase Journey began in full force.<br><br>...<br><br><u>6. Siege of the Grove of Epiphany</u><br>Time: Light Calendar 3930. Location: Grove of Epiphany. Key Generals: Apollonius, Cerydra<br><br>When the Imperator drowned Okhema's Elders in the lake and declared her dream of slaying the Titans, the world dismissed her as a raving despot. History had seen plenty of tyrants make wild claims in their lust for power. Even Okhema's archrival, Castrum Kremnos, brushed it off as a cheap stunt to rally support. After that, the Imperator's actions seemed to be proof that her previous speech was just a moment of passion because, for the next twenty years, she seemed to be quietly, silently, and methodically building her forces. Spies from Ladon who escaped Okhema claimed she had gathered thousands of Chrysos Heirs into a specially structured army, one strong enough to flatten any city-state in half a day. Fear rippled through the states, except for the ever-restless Castrum Kremnos, eager to test their blades. But bound by the peace treaty, all they could do was sharpen their weapons in silence.<br><br>Light Calendar 3930. \"Dux Helkolithist\" Apollonius, once a sage of the Grove and now an Advisor of the Flame-Chase Army, was sent as an envoy to the Grove and did not return after three months. The Imperator then dispatched \"Dux Carminum\" Verginia and one split body of \"Dux Fatorum\" Tribios to the Grove. They, too, vanished without a trace. Rumors swirled that the Four Sages from the Lotophagist, Caprist, Nodist, and Venerationist schools hated the Imperator, imprisoning her envoys and plotting to overthrow her rule. Not long after, the Imperator herself showed up with a small retinue, oddly without the famed warriors \"Dux Gladiorum,\" \"Dux Fragoris,\" and \"Dux Brumalis.\" The scholars of the Grove, seeing her seemingly weak force, lowered their guard and welcomed her beneath the branches of Cerces. But the Imperator's few dozen followers weren't what they seemed. They were the first elite Flame-Chase Army, all Chrysos Heirs trained and battle-ready.<br><br>That very day, the Grove of Epiphany fell. The Imperator threw the Four Sages into prison and proudly displayed her greatest prize: the Coreflame of \"Romance.\" She then declared her next target would be Georios the Earth Titan, who was slumbering deep beneath the Oleinus Plateau.<br><br>...<br><br><u>7. The Oleinus Skirmish</u><br>Time: Light Calendar 3956. Location: Oleinus Plateau. Key General: Cerydra<br><br>It wasn't until Mnestia's fall that the world finally realized Seliose and Tribios hadn't sparked a mere ember, but a blazing wildfire capable of turning the skies red. Now, the Imperator was pouring the lives of thousands of Chrysos Heirs, including her own, into the flames, determined to melt away this apocalyptic cage.<br><br>No one dared underestimate the Imperator's ambition anymore. Knowing the Flame-Chase tyrant had set her sights on the god of Earth, the city-states and tribes blessed by that Titan banded together to defend their god. But unlike the powerless Mnestia, Georios, one of the Foundation Titans, had the strength to level mountains and carve valleys. Also, no one knew exactly where they hid. So the Imperator was forced to lie low for years.<br><br>Since Light Calendar 3950, tremors rocked all over Amphoreus, as if Georios sensed their fate. In early 3955, an unprecedented quake tore through the Oleinus Plateau, and Georios's battered divine form rose from the abyss. The Imperator realized the Titan would soon be out of control because of the black tide, so she stopped waiting. At the end of the year, she led her Flame-Chase Army west in a massive campaign from Okhema. Early in Light Calendar 3956, they crossed the Tretos Plains into Oleinus, only to be ambushed. Oleinus, Odressian, Icaria, and Handak, four farming city-states once under the Earth Titan's protection, united to block the Imperator's advance.<br><br>These city-states had been ravaged by earthquakes and were poorly armed, their forces mostly farmers, not a match for the Flame-Chase Army. But the Imperator didn't come in swinging like before, unleashing brutal slaughter. Instead, she ordered her Chrysos Heir elites to swiftly break the lines, focusing on wounding and disarming rather than outright killing, rendering their resistance powerless. After the battle, the Imperator didn't punish the prisoners. Instead, she left Apollonius and others behind to help with disaster relief. The Imperator declared that humanity would never forget the blessings Georios once bestowed. Precisely because of that, the revered Titan needed their loyal creations to set them free when they were dragged into endless torment by the black tide, take up their divine authority, and continue protecting humankind.<br><br>Many hostile city-states had hoped the Imperator would be disgraced for staining her hands with innocent blood, but the Oleinus campaign actually managed to largely reverse public opinion. As a prelude to the assault on Georios, the Flame-Chase Army came out unscathed, in both numbers and reputation, and even won over some farming city-states. It was a victory on every front.<br><br>...<br><br><u>8. Assault on Georios</u><br>Time: Light Calendar 3957. Location: Oleinus Plateau. Key General: Terravox<br><br>In Light Calendar 3957, a split body of Tribios infiltrated deep behind enemy lines and located Georios's divine form. By then, the Mountain Dwellers, fiercely loyal to Georios, had joined the battle. These warriors were impossible to reason with, neither moved by logic nor lofty ideals. They refused to let their creator be slain. Thus, a war was inevitable.<br><br>Led by the legendary Mountainbreaker Geocles, the army of Mountain Dwellers shielded Georios from the front lines. Each one of them was born with godlike strength and equipped with unlimited, top-tier gear. Their formations were nearly impenetrable. The dromas cavalry was a nightmare for the Flame-Chase Army. Even Chrysos Heirs, with their divine blood, struggled to gain ground against the stampeding beasts. The Imperator trained her soldiers to target the dromases' eyes, legs, and riders, setting traps made of refined iron, but still couldn't tip the scales in her favor.<br><br>At the critical moment, reinforcements arrived, one never before seen on the battlefield. A giant dragon named Terravox stepped slowly out of the retreating Flame-Chase Army and into the dromases' ranks. Its footsteps made every dromas tremble and kneel. Its roar and stomp crushed even the best-armed Mountain Dweller. With Terravox holding the front lines, the Imperator ordered Seneca to lead elite troops around the flank, capturing Geocles and other Mountain Dweller leaders. Ultimately, the Imperator led her battered army to the chasm above Georios's resting place.<br><br>Hysilens and several Chrysos Heir warriors plunged resolutely into the abyss. After a fierce battle, only Hysilens returned in disappointment. The depths of the earth were not a good battleground for her to exercise her strength. But it was still Terravox, the great dragon, who turned the tide. Silent and alone, it dove into the chasm. The ground shook violently, and three days later, the Georios's Coreflame finally rose back to the surface.<br><br>When Georios fell, violent earthquakes ripped through all of Amphoreus. Land split apart, rivers changed course and flooded, and city-states crumbled into ruin. At the darkest hour, a roar echoed up from the abyss. Terravox, who had inherited the divine authority of Earth, tore the cracked land asunder, using its own massive body to fuse it back together. Its godslaying act unleashed a cataclysmic quake, but it was also the one who stopped it.<br><br>After the battle, the Imperator led the remaining troops back to Okhema. Soon after, she publicly honored the mysterious giant dragon Terravox with the title \"Dux Terrae,\" and declared their next target: Talanton.<br><br>...<br><br><u>9. Dolos Riverbed Melee Battle</u><br>Time: Light Calendar 3959. Location: Dolos Plains. Key Generals: Labienus, Seneca<br><br>In Light Calendar 3953, the fifty-year peace treaty between Kremnos and Okhema came to an end. That same year, Kremnos crowned a new king, Eurypon. At the time, Amphoreus was still reeling from Georios's final agony, but the Kremnoans didn't seize the moment for conquest. Instead, after Georios's passing, they anchored their mobile fortress to the east of Janusopolis, where Talanton's Coreflame was located. They then stationed their troops on the Dolos Plains, claiming they were sent by the Temple of the Three Fates to protect the Titan of Law. Janusopolis welcomed this move that played one enemy against another with open arms.<br><br>The Imperator didn't panic, for she knew Kremnos was after a decisive showdown and nothing more. In Light Calendar 3959, she ordered Labienus and Seneca, old acquaintances familiar with the Kremnoan army, to lead over three hundred Chrysos Heir warriors and tens of thousands of mortals boldly into the Dolos Riverbed. When the two armies met, no formal challenge was needed. They silently drew their blades and clashed immediately.<br><br>Unlike a bloody war, this battle resembled a grand Kremnos Festival, with both sides holding back and suffering few casualties. This was a stark departure from Kremnoans' usual \"Valorous Death Before Glorious Return\" ethos. The reason behind this was that their new king, Eurypon, was no ordinary ruler. A Chrysos Heir himself, he easily dominated the Kremnos Festival, showing unmatched courage and a bold vision for reform. The new queen, Gorgo, was equally formidable, matching Eurypon blow for blow and sharing his doubts about old traditions. Under their leadership, Kremnoans, once fixated solely on blood and glory, began to take a broader view of the world's fate.<br><br>In the battle at the Dolos Riverbed, Eurypon and Gorgo personally took the field, clashing evenly against Labienus and Seneca. After the fight, the four retired to their tents. What they discussed remains a mystery. Soon after, Kremnos announced a full withdrawal. Janusopolis, sensing impending disaster, was about to issue a divine edict calling on allied forces to quell the threat when the Flame-Chase Army suddenly appeared at their gates. While Labienus and Seneca held the Kremnoan army at bay, the Imperator and Hysilens led the remaining two hundred Chrysos Heirs on a daring trek across the eastern ridges of the Campa Mountains that cut off Okhema from Janusopolis, and struck directly at the doors of the Temple of the Three Fates.<br><br>...<br><br><u>10. Siege of Janusopolis</u><br>Time: Light Calendar 3960. Location: Janusopolis. Key General: Cerydra<br><br>...<br><br>After linking up with Labienus and Seneca's main forces, the Imperator sent envoys into the city to demand surrender, while she set up camp outside Janusopolis and held position. When the city refused to surrender, the Imperator deployed troops to guard all key roads, cutting off any external reinforcements. She then pressured the city relentlessly, claiming the Kremnoan army was also eyeing the tripartite prophecy and inviting Janusopolis to accept Okhema's protection, but the offer was turned down again. In the end, the Imperator chose to initiate a secret negotiation, the details of which no one knows.<br><br>Legend says this secret talk was aided by the famed 300 Rogues of Dolos. Led by the Dolosian native Cifera, the ninety-seventh of the 300 Rogues, \"Bladed Black Velvet\" Ferrum, joined the cause. Ferrum spent three days digging a secret tunnel, based on an escape route revealed by Tribios, that led straight to the chamber where the Scale of Justice was located. Cerydra herself led a small team, including Dux Gladiorum, through the tunnel and into the city, where they unexpectedly ran into several stubborn priests...<br><br>..."

            {
                "Desc": "Preface<br>This manual is certified by the Village Committee of Aedes Elysiae, embodying the collective wisdom of generations, blessed by the Oronyx Altar. May all readers approach with reverence, use this knowledge wisely, and live in harmony with the earth.<br><br>Wheat Field Selection<br>Choose sheltered, sunny locations for wheat fields, with soil that clumps when rolled between fingertips without crumbling. If the soil emits an earthy fragrance when inhaled, it promises a bountiful harvest. Stay clear of areas with frequent night mists, which may be influenced by Zagreus's tricks.<br>By Georios's grace, our village's finest soil is located southwest of the altar, extending to the forest's edge where the white flowers bloom. This blessed land yields two harvests yearly, producing heavy, plump ears of wheat.<br><br>Irrigation System Construction<br>Our village's irrigation follows the natural design of Georios's vein, mirroring the earth's patterns. The main channel draws water from elevated terrain, with tributary channels branching like a tree. Ideal dimensions are two feet wide and one and a half feet deep. The channel bottom should be lined with cobbles and sides reinforced with stone, maintaining water flow without saturating adjacent fields.<br>The main channel requires annual dredging during the Month of Fortune to prevent blockage. The collected silt, once dried, creates premium fertilizer, particularly beneficial for flower gardens.<br><br>Water Wheel and Distribution Techniques<br>The water wheel serves as the heart of our irrigation system and must be crafted from durable hardwood with twelve paddles, representing the Twelve Titans' protection. Oil the wooden axle every fortnight to maintain smooth rotation. Inspect the stone groove where the wheel sits regularly for cracks or damage.<br>Water allocation follows the village committee's agreement: wheat fields receive priority during the Month of Cultivation, flower fields during the Month of Joy, and equal distribution in remaining months. Drought conditions necessitate special arrangements.<br><br>Irrigation Timing and Frequency<br>Wheat field irrigation schedule:<br>Post-sowing: Moisten soil to a depth of one finger<br>Pre-heading: Saturate soil to a depth of three fingers<br>Grain filling period: Water moderately to prevent crop lodging<br><br>Flower field irrigation timing:<br>Month of Everday: Twice daily (morning and evening), moderate volume<br>Month of Freedom through Month of Reaping: Daily watering<br>Month of Mourning through Month of Fortune: Every five days, with frost protection<br>Note: Always consider Aquila's mood (cloud formations) when scheduling irrigation. If clouds appear dense and mountainous, postpone watering to avoid potential flood damage from imminent rainfall.<br><br>Nine-Year Crop Rotation Method<br>Our village developed a nine-year crop rotation system aligned with Titan numerology to sustain soil fertility indefinitely. The sequence follows:<br>1. Wheat (soil depleting)<br>2. Legumes (soil enriching)<br>3. Root crops (neutral impact)<br>4. Wheat (soil depleting)<br>5. Vegetables and fruits (moderately depleting)<br>6. Legumes (soil enriching)<br>7. Wheat (soil depleting)<br>8. Medicinal herbs and spices (mildly depleting)<br>9. Fallow period (soil restoration)<br>Mark each field's rotation year using stone pillars carved with appropriate symbols along field borders. The Cultivation Manager oversees this system to prevent errors.<br><br>Field Ridges and Boundary Stones<br>Construct field ridges one foot wide and half a foot high using compacted soil, then plant with herbs. This technique not only prevents erosion but also attracts beneficial insects while deterring pests.<br>Redraw boundary lines every three years to maintain clear borders despite soil erosion. Place a Bronze Coin beneath each boundary stone as a symbol of Talanton's impartial justice.<br><br>Fallow Field Management<br>Never neglect fallow fields. Instead, sow them with plant fertilizers such as red clover or milk vetch. Once these plants reach knee height, plow them under to decompose within the soil.<br>Plant aromatic herbs like mint and mugwort around fallow field perimeters to discourage pests. Strictly prohibit livestock grazing on fallow fields to preserve soil structure integrity.<br><br>Composting Techniques<br>Position compost pits in sheltered, sunny locations away from water sources. Layer materials as follows:<br>Bottom: Coarse branches and dry hay<br>Middle: Stable manure, hearth ash, and food remnants<br>Top: A covering of fine soil<br>Turn the contents weekly to ensure thorough decomposition. Well-matured compost appears dark brown, feels warm to touch, and emits an earthy aroma without any foul smell.<br><br>Special Fertilizer Recipes<br>1. Wheat Field Formula:<br>Seven parts well-decomposed manure<br>Two parts wood ash<br>One part fish bone meal<br>A small quantity of dew collected from the Oronyx Altar<br><br>2. Flower Field Formula:<br>Five parts decomposed leaf matter<br>Three parts bird droppings<br>Two parts fine sand<br>A sprinkle of ground seashell powder<br>Apply within half an hour of opening and avoid Aquila's intense midday sun to preserve nutrient potency.<br><br>Liquid Fertilizer Preparation<br>Liquid fertilizer works best for young seedlings and flowering plants. Prepare by filling a large wooden barrel with:<br>One basket of fresh shrub ash<br>Three ladles of animal urine<br>Ten ladles of clean water<br>Allow to steep for seven days, then dilute to one-tenth strength before application. Caution: The concentrated solution will burn plants if applied directly.<br><br>Sowing Ceremony<br>The day before sowing begins, villagers gather at the Oronyx Altar where the priest conducts a blessing ceremony. Required offerings include:<br>Small samples of various seeds<br>A bowl of pure spring water<br>A pitcher of freshly brewed wheat nectar<br>A crown woven from wheat stalks<br>During the ceremony, the priest immerses the seeds in water as the congregation joins in reciting sacred prayers.<br><br>The Field Walk<br>On the third day of the Month of Everday, villagers join hands and encircle the wheat fields while singing the traditional \"Song of Wheat Waves.\" This ritual banishes harmful miasma and ensures robust wheat growth.<br>Processions must proceed clockwise, following Aquila's celestial path. The priest carries a long willow branch, softly sweeping it across the wheat, a symbolic act of nurturing growth.<br><br>Harvest Thanksgiving<br>Upon completing the harvest, leave a small section of wheat uncut as gratitude for the earth's bounty.<br>As the final cart of wheat enters the village, residents form a double line, celebrating with songs and dances. Each family prepares small cakes from newly harvested wheat and presents them at the Oronyx Altar. Following the priest's blessing, these cakes are shared among all, a celebration of abundance and community spirit.<br><br>Afterword<br>This volume preserves agricultural knowledge accumulated through generations. We commit these practices to writing so they may guide future villagers. May Aedes Elysiae forever enjoy billowing wheat fields, sweet-scented blossoms, prosperous inhabitants, and the Titans' divine protection."

The paper has yellowed with age, the ink gently faded.]</i><br><br><br>Ethics Lesson 10: Diligence<br><br>Miss Pythias once said: The mountains are the spine of the earth, and diligence is the spine of humanity.<br><br>The land grants us all we need: trees to shelter us, grain to feed us, flax to clothe us. Yet none of these gifts appear by chance. A house untended crumbles into dust, a field neglected grows barren, flax left unharvested fades into wild greenery. Only through labor can harvest be earned.<br><br>Engrave \"diligence\" deep within your heart. Treasure the act of creating, not merely receiving. Guard against any thought of reward without effort. Of course, diligence does not mean you must walk alone. Life is a wide and wild frontier, and the young hold infinite possibilities.<br><br>Farmer, fisherman, hunter, sailor, priest... You name it, pour your spirit into it. Tend your craft as you would tend the land. Do not lose the backbone that makes you human.<br><br><br>Ethics Lesson 11: Kindness<br><br>Miss Pythias said: Kindness is the bond that turns \"I\" into \"we.\"<br><br>The heart is like a still pond, it reflects whoever stands before it. Every sincere act of kindness sends ripples across another's soul, gentle and lasting. Think back to the last time Uncle Galba handed out fruit preserves at the schoolhouse. Did you feel a sudden urge to return the favor? That is the invisible thread kindness weaves: a bond of spirit, growing stronger with every small gesture, extending ever outward.<br><br>Be the first to extend a helping hand and pass kindness forward. It begins with a friendly greeting, a warm welcome, a generous sharing, a tolerant understanding, and a sincere trust.<br><br>Someday, these small acts of kindness will weave into a web of friendship that connects us all. This web will shield us from conflict, suspicion, and indifference, making our world a better place.<br><br><br>Virtue Lesson Twelve: Valuing Time<br><br>Miss Pythias says that the time Oronyx bestows upon each person is even more just than Talanton's verdict.<br><br>Whether aristocrat or civilian, all people live between the same Entry Hour and Curtain-Fall Hour each day. A merchant may possess many times more Balance Coins than a beggar, but in one Lucid Hour, both can only read through a single book. Oronyx allows moonlight to bathe every leaf equally, yet will not reforge the annual rings of rotting wood.<br><br>Time flows like an endless river, waiting for no one and vanishing in an instant. No man ever steps in the same river twice, nor catches the water that has already flowed downstream. All we can do is treasure each moment of the present.<br><br>Those skilled at managing time gather scattered moments of leisure like collecting grains of wheat, using them to enrich their lives. Act now — do what you want to do, do what you should do, and let the vibrant energy of life flow through every moment you experience. Don't waste your years in worry and waiting, and never let empty idleness claim your precious memories."

On the wheatgrass-stitched paper, the handwriting blurs at the edges, softened by seeping water.</i><br><br>Dear straynger who finds this drift bottle in the future,<br><br>It's currently the Month of Fortune, the final month of the year. Everyone in the village says if you do something tied to fortune on the last day of this month, you might be blessed with unexpeckted good luck.<br>So, I decided to write this letter and cast it into the sea. Just let the currents decide where it goes.<br>I want to share a little about our village... and my dream.<br><br>Our little village is called Aedes Elysiae. Have you ever heard of it?<br>Let me tell you a bit about it: We've got golden wheat fields that ripple like the sea, and tall, tall trees that shed their leaves. Right in the center of the village stands a statue of Oronyx.<br>At the end of each year, the village gathers to celebrate the Winter Solstice. We leave offerings at the statue: roast graype pies, herb-fryed fish, goat's milk... all kinds of tasty food.<br>Last year, I sneaked some malt candy and ended up with a tooth ripped straight out. Mom and Dad said if you throw a lost tooth under a tree, or bury it beneath a rock, a new one will grow back. Just like a seedling sprouting from the soil.<br>I remember searching and searching, pushing through the tangled grass behind our courtyard, until I found this mysterious hole. I tossed the tooth inside, cupped my hands like a horn, and yelled, \"Heeey — come ouuuut!\"<br>Nothing happened. When I went back this year... the hole was gone. Weird, right?<br><br>You don't think I'm being childish, do you? I'm not like Cyrene. She can already host the festival, and she's great at telling the future with orecale cards.<br>They say the card you draw shows what kind of person you'll become. Last time, I drew the \"Deliverer.\" Everyone went \"Woooow.\"<br>People really like the Deliverer, but I'd rather be a Wonderer or a Skholar. Well, being a Deliverer sounds super amayzing, but it also means carrying a really, really heavy berden.<br>I'm not that amazing, so I can't be the Deliverer.<br><br>Few in Aedes Elysiae ever jerney far. We don't hear much about the outside world. All I know is there are all kinds of city-states out there and lots of great heroes. The bad part is, they're always at wars.<br>I don't like wars.<br>If the world were more like our village, where everyone knows each other and works together, harvesting grain, hearding sheep, why would we even need a Deliverer?<br><br>But Mrs. Pythias and Uncle Galba both say that one day, when I'm a little older, I should go see the world for myself.<br>If I could go anywhere, I'd visit the mighty Castrum Creamnose, find the greatest craftsman, and ask them to forje me a sword.<br>With that sword, I'd protect our little village. I want no part in wars.<br>Right now, I don't even have a sword of my own, just a stick and a hoe.<br><br>Oh! And by then, I hope the outside world no longer needs a Deliverer.<br>That would be the best thing ever.<br><br>So that's my home, and that's my dream. What about you? What's your home like? What do you dream of?<br>You could write it down, too. Toss it into the sea, and let the tides carry it to the next stop.<br><br>Whoops! Just realized this letter has missspeelings, just like my essays in Mrs. Pythias's class.<br>Please don't let her be the one who finds this, or I'm totally getting points docked and detenshun!"

He loved to sit beneath the olive tree near the altar of Oronyx, drifting into dreams as he watched the clouds shift into fantastical shapes.<br><br>One evening, as the sky turned a fiery orange, the boy saw a glowing fairy flutter out of a hollow in the olive tree. It sparkled like a star on a leap, gleaming brightly in the twilight.<br><br>\"Hello, little star!\" the boy whispered. The fairy giggled, waved at him, then darted back into the tree.<br><br>Curious, the boy crawled into the hollow and found himself in a magical tunnel! He crawled on, deeper and deeper, until he arrived at a breathtaking place — the flowers here sang, mushrooms grew as big as little houses, and countless glowing fairies danced in the sky.<br><br>\"Welcome to our kingdom!\" a tiny fairy, wearing a crown of dandelions, said as he skipped around. \"I'm Prince Stardust! You're the first human to find us!\"<br><br>The boy looked around and saw that the fairies lived in tree hollows and mushroom houses, eating only wild fruits and honey.<br><br>\"When winter comes, do you get hungry?\" he asked.<br><br>Stardust nodded, his glow dimming. \"In winter, we have no fruits to eat. We must sleep on empty stomachs.\"<br><br>\"I'll teach you how to grow food!\" the boy said in exhilaration.<br><br>He brought magical seeds and planted them in a sunlit patch of earth. The fairies watched wide-eyed as he pressed the seeds into the soil.<br><br>\"Seeds need a kiss from the sun and a hug from the rain,\" the boy explained, \"and then they will become delicious food! Just like Oronyx's miracle — time will turn tiny seeds into great treasures!\"<br><br>The fairies clapped and cheered, eagerly mimicking him as they planted more seeds.<br><br>The boy also brought a magical pot with him. \"This is the blessed magical cauldron,\" he said mysteriously. \"It makes food taste sweeter and more fragrant!\"<br><br>With the boy's help, the fairies quickly learned how to brew soup, bake bread, and make desserts. The fairies also learned how to store food for the winter.<br><br>Before long, the fairy kingdom was filled with joy. The fields bloomed with vegetables, and the air in the kitchens was filled with the fragrance of baking bread and sweet treats. The fairies no longer feared going hungry in winter.<br><br>When it was time to leave, the boy made a promise to the fairies. \"When spring arrives and the flowers bloom, I'll return with more friends!\"<br><br>The fairies cheered, adorning the kingdom with the brightest flowers for more guests in the days to come.<br><br>\"I'll be back soon!\" the boy called, waving as he crawled back out of the tree hollow.<br><br>But after he left, the fairies have been waiting, day and night, and yet the boy never returned. The fairies lit never-ending firefly lanterns, hoping they would guide him back to the kingdom.<br><br>Now, when the moonlight spills over the wheat fields, you might hear the fairies singing a lullaby:<br><br>\"Little boy, remember us still! Return with your friends to our fairy-filled hill.\"<br><br>And even today, the fairies are still waiting, for promises in this land are never forgotten."

As a horror director, I'd rather hear audiences laughing about being scared than witness endless copyright tragedies.<br><br><b>Reporter:</b> Many believe ███████'s death directly influenced your decision to tear up the patent, serving both as a memorial to her and a gift to the newly formed Himemia Films. What's your comment on this?<br><br><b>Grady:</b> ███████'s death was a complete tragedy. When almost everyone turned their backs on her, she still sang for those most vulnerable, ultimately losing her life during a charity performance. We all bear responsibility for what happened.<br><br><b>Reporter:</b> Are you suggesting that the Alfalfa Family and Mr. Alfalfa played a role in this?<br><br><b>Grady:</b> No, absolutely not. The Alfalfa Family has always been an angel investor in entertainment, helping countless Iris Family artists rise to fame. Mr. Alfalfa remains an invaluable Grady Films partner. I'm certain we'll collaborate even more closely in the future."

How did you convince the company inspector to allow an inmate to form a business behind bars?<br><br><b>Grady:</b> For most IPC Dogs, it comes down to one thing — profit. When prisoners were awake, IPC's Nickodeum Cinemas successfully drained what little money inmates had. But dreams? Well, before they realized what was happening, my lawyer friends had already put my name on the dream bubble movie technology patent.<br><br>They wanted to squeeze every last coin from prisoners' savings into their own pockets.

But today's Grady Films is practically a brand-new company, wouldn't you say?<br><br><b>Grady:</b> Yes, all thanks to Mr. McCoy's excessive confidence. He actually gave me, the so-called honorary chairman, a dividend share, treating it like spare change. So prisoners' savings, which should have flowed 100% back to the IPC, now had a tiny stream diverted to me. Though barely significant, that money successfully helped fund the initial stages of Penacony's \"War of Independence.\"<br><br>McCoy died while trying to crush the rebellion, and the original Grady company became history. But the Nickodeum Cinemas and assets he left behind formed the foundation for rebuilding our film industry later.

On this occasion, we tracked down director Grady to discover how he achieved such remarkable success.<br><br><b>Reporter:</b> The creation of dream bubble movies is a revolutionary technology. Developing such an innovation in prison seems especially challenging. How did you create this entirely new technology from scratch?<br><br><b>Grady:</b> It all started when I was washing my face. I spotted dreamscape memoria residue on the mirror and had a revelation — dreams might be hard to grasp, but the memoria that hold them can be controlled.<br><br>If I could build a machine to stabilize memoria while they held dream imagery and then capture them, I'd essentially have a dream camera! Luckily, I knew a little about machine repair from before my imprisonment. I collected discarded parts from around the prison and spent about a year or two experimenting until I finally created this little contraption.<br><br><b>Reporter:</b> What inspired you to make movies in prison? And why horror films specifically?<br><br><b>Grady:</b> Initially, I just recorded dream scenes with my device, but that got old pretty fast. Then █████ suggested, \"Why don't you make a movie? You've got nothing but time.\" Entertaining yourself gets dull eventually, but bringing some thrill to our dreary prison life though...<br><br>Filming in the Synesthesia Dreamscape proved tricky at first. I thought dreams would let me create anything I wanted, but memoria typically behaved in one of two extremes. They're either too stable, just like reality, forcing us to manually create props and sets, or, too chaotic, like jelly, where an actor's face could transform nine times within one second. Dreams were so unpredictable that we ended up shooting many scenes on physical sets in the actual prison.<br><br>As for why horror films: First, they're relatively cheap to make with fewer technical demands. Second, after toggling between prison life and nightmares for so long, I figured people needed something more thrilling. And honestly, the very last thing I did before imprisonment was watching a horror movie in a theater. I only got halfway through before IPC Dogs dragged me onto their ship. Perhaps making horror films is my way of finishing that interrupted movie.<br><br>...<br><br>(A roughly produced newspaper, widely distributed during the prison era, secured publishing rights after Ozaka bribed prison officials)"

She's just like...\"<br>\"So terrifying...\"<br><br>A stern figure approached rapidly — it was █████, the source of the irritation.<br>Mnestia offered Cerces a smile, then turned and walked away.<br><br>█████ cast a sharp glance in the direction of the butterfly-winged girl's departure, then shifted his gaze back to Cerces.<br><br>First came perfunctory reports and spiritless small talk, then escalation to arguments that resembled personal attacks—<br><br>\"Do you truly understand...\"<br>\"I don't need to. Let me be direct, Cerces.\"<br>\"To romance a student, even your own creation, don't you find that perverse—?\"<br>\"Pow!\"<br>This was the first time the embodiment of reason allowed emotions to govern her mind. The sensation left on her palm felt as if it would scorch through to the heart of the tree.<br><br>From nearby came the sound of running footsteps — familiar yet somehow strange.

The tide has risen higher than ever before, already reaching the fifth step of the stone stairway to our residence. The priests insist it's merely a seasonal high tide that will soon recede, but having lived in Styxia for thirty years, I've never witnessed water levels like this.<br><br>Leandro from the harbor went fishing three days ago and reported that the seawater had become unusually turbid, appearing as if mixed with ink. Beneath the surface, he glimpsed strange shadows, not human in form yet possessing distinct outlines. After returning, he developed a high fever and has remained bedridden since.<br><br>Month of Balance, Day ██<br>The city's feasts have grown increasingly frenzied. Grand celebrations that once occurred only during the Month of Joy now happen almost daily. At the Andros family's banquet last night, I witnessed two normally well-mannered women treading grapes barefoot, emitting strange laughter, and then directly drinking the dirt-laden juice. They claimed to be mimicking Phagousa's ritual ceremonies, though I've never heard of such an absurd form of worship.<br><br>Prices at the Market have risen by thirty percent. The honey brew merchant reports that the brewing process has become exceptionally difficult lately — the yeast cultures mysteriously rot. Only by distilling with seawater collected directly from the harbor can they produce proper wine.<br>Fortunately, our Doris is clear-minded enough to advise us to minimize our consumption of the city's water and wine.<br><br>Month of Everday, Day ██<br>Last night, strange music emanated from the harbor. It wasn't produced by any instrument, but seemed to rise from the ocean depths. The low, haunting melody sounded as if it were telling an ancient tale, compelling people to approach the shore. Several neighbors' children sleepwalked to the dock last night; they claimed to have seen \"the goddess in the water\" performing and wanted to get closer.<br><br>The priests have forbidden all forms of musical performance and deployed soldiers to patrol the docks. For some reason, I can't shake the feeling that they're acting from fear rather than a genuine desire to protect us.<br><br>Month of Everday, Day ██<br>Today I met Nora, the cloth merchant, at the market. She revealed that the situation in her district was far more dire than we had imagined. The spirit water pool in Phagousa's temple suddenly dried up three days ago, and despite their best efforts, the priests cannot replenish it. More alarming still, strange cracks have appeared on the wall behind the deity statue, forming patterns or script that no one can decipher.<br><br>Nora also shared a peculiar rumor: Some claim to have seen in their dreams a woman playing a lyre, draped in black veils, with eyes gleaming like seawater. She allegedly told dreamers that Styxia would soon face a great transformation, and only \"those who hear her voice\" would be saved. Some city residents have begun referring to her as the \"prophetic sea musician\" — despite the priests' determined efforts to suppress such rumors.<br><br>Month of Freedom, Day ██<br>We've finally decided to evacuate with our entire family. The seawater has reached the highest watermark at the dock, yet some remain oblivious, still immersed in endless revelry. Our family and the neighboring Milon household have decided to journey to Okhema together. Reportedly, the Worldbearing Titan's protection extends there, and the tides of darkness have not yet invaded those lands. We plan to slip away quietly tonight from the northern dock exit. We pray to Phagousa for safe passage.<br><br>Month of Freedom, Day ██<br>We've been traveling for three days now. Last night, the Milon family's youngest child suddenly developed a high fever, continuously muttering strange phrases that resembled an ancient ballad. His father decided to take him back to the city for medical treatment, though we all know there is little hope to be found there.<br><br>This morning, looking back at Styxia from the hillside, I was horrified to discover the entire city enveloped in a strange aura, with seawater shimmering with an unnatural blue radiance in the sunlight. From a distance, those magnificent buildings seemed to twist and distort in the water, as if they were merely illusions.<br><br>Month of Weaving, Day ██<br>We encountered several other fleeing townspeople. They brought even more horrifying news: The seawater in Styxia has begun displaying strange colors and textures — sometimes thick as honey, other times solid as glass. Those who remained in the city have begun undergoing bizarre transformations, ███ ███████ ████ █████ ███.<br><br>Even more disturbing is that at night, the entire city bathes in an indescribable glow, as if enveloped by some gigantic amniotic membrane. They say this is Phagousa's punishment, but I can't help wondering: Is this the Titans' wrath, or is some power even greater than the Titans at work?<br><br>We've decided to continue northward to Okhema. Along the way, we've heard rumors of someone named ██████████ who can supposedly appease Phagousa's wrath, but these are merely legends fabricated by desperate people. We common folk can only rely on our own feet to flee this disaster.<br><br>Month of Weaving, Day ██<br>Tonight, after the children fell asleep, I secretly examined a small vial of seawater I brought from the city. It was the last drop collected from the spirit water pool in Phagousa's temple before we left. In the moonlight, it displays a strange shimmer, as if something moves within it, unlike any ordinary water.<br><br>By chance, I discovered that gently tapping the vial with my fingertip produces a peculiar sound, like distant lyre notes echoing. At that moment, I seemed to glimpse a mysterious woman standing upon the sea surface, sorrowfully playing a melody that no one could understand.<br><br>I don't know if this was illusion or reality. But if such a being truly exists, one who can hear the sorrows of Styxians, then as we embark on this uncertain journey, please grant us a flicker of hope — even if it's merely a beautiful dream.<br><br>Okhema is now within reach. Taking one final glance back at my homeland, the beautiful scenery of old is nowhere to be seen — only distorted masses of light and shadow undulating on the sea level, resembling foam heaped by waves before dawn, dissolving one by one to gradually reveal its cold and true nature..."

By doing so, we seek to refine fundamental methodologies in cryptozoological research and lay a practical and theoretical foundation for further studies on Aquila's creations.<br><br><b>Diet</b><br>Herbivorous. Primarily feeds on grass, alfalfa, and grains. Shows a strong preference for brightly colored fruits such as wild apples, olives, and berries.<br>Possibly due to its highly domesticated nature, the winged beast's eating habits closely resemble those of humans — three meals a day.<br><br>During a single midday feeding session, Little Ica consumed ten wild apples. An additional ten were offered and immediately consumed. Another twenty were also consumed without hesitation. A single burp was observed. Five more apples were given. Once again, immediately consumed. Observation suspended due to budget constraints.<br><br><b>Fur</b><br>Short, soft white down covering its body. Mane of deep blue-green fur running from forehead to nape. Long white feathers on its wings.<br>Collected sample fur: translucent, fire-resistant, naturally disintegrates after a quint. When exposed to moonlight, it floats slightly. For tactile assessment, recorded as follows:<br><br>Warm. Soft. Like clouds. During Action Hour breaks, resting one's head in its fur felt like floating — every worry melting into warmth...<br><i>(Editorial Note: While immersive observations are encouraged...

This suggests they belong to the same lineage — perhaps even share a deeper connection.<br><br>Though somewhat clumsy, it comprehends simple verbal communication. Vocabulary is slightly more limited than a chimera's, roughly on par with a five-year-old child.<br>Perhaps due to being one of Aquila's creations, it appears responsive to other Titan Miracles. Occasionally, it even engages in conversations with the White Dryads.<br><br><b>Sleep Patterns</b><br>After prolonged conversation or use of rainbows, Little Ica requires extended rest. Even upon waking, it takes a long time before it can communicate clearly again.<br>Its divine blessing seems unstable and is gradually fading... Could the reason be that Aquila no longer watches over the Skyfolk?<br><br>I told it: \"To keep you alive, strong, and lively, you mustn't talk to the White Dryads anymore!\"<br>I observed it responding with \"...Dudu du?\"<br><i>(Editorial Note: Such raw transcripts should be included in the appendix, not the main report.)</i>"

After that, golden banners veiled the sky, heroes laid down their weapons against one another, and all rushed headlong into the torrent of fate. However, the true origins of that expedition were far more complex than what poets have sung. Today, I shall unveil the secrets that ordinary chronicles dare not mention.<br><br>Many believe that Okhema, as the Eternal Holy City, was destined to stand for a thousand years without faltering. Yet history tells us otherwise — it has faced the brink of conquest more than once. Whether driven by long-held grudges or the manipulations of schemers. In the year 3867 of the Light Calendar, the city-states of Loukas, Icaria, and Corinth formed an allied army and laid siege to Okhema. It was an army of overwhelming scale — warriors clad in bronze helmets and iron armor lined up in formations vast enough to fill the Dawncloud...<br><br>████<i>Content missing, seemingly burned away.</i>████<br><br>Thus, the tyrant of Loukas's scheme succeeded. The three frontier generals perished one after another in the ensuing chaos. The soldiers stationed at the outer fortress, cut off from reinforcements and supplies, were left with no choice but to surrender. For a time, the surroundings of the holy city lay utterly defenseless, as fragile as an egg on the edge of a precipice.<br><br>News of the approaching allied army swiftly reached Okhema. The elders convened a three-day citizens' assembly, which ultimately achieved nothing but panic. Nobles and wealthy merchants locked themselves in their lavish apartments, hiring guards to stand watch in shifts for the illusion of security. Meanwhile, commoners and priests spent their days in prayer, hoping for a divine miracle to punish the invaders and save Okhema from its impending doom.<br><br>████<i>Content missing, seemingly burned away.</i>████<br><br>Okhema was indeed saved. But its saviors were not the gods — it was a mysterious army that suddenly appeared on the battlefield. Like a fish slipping into the fray, it bore no banners of any known city-state. Its formations were disciplined, its movements flawlessly coordinated. At the forefront, a warrior wielded a blade curved like a bow from a stringed instrument, cutting through the enemy ranks as though spilling ink upon a battlefield canvas. Now we know her name — she was the demigod of the Ocean, Dux Gladiorum, Hysilens. In that battle alone, she slew sixty thousand foes. The blood that soaked her hem turned her into a specter in the eyes of the citizens.<br><br>After securing the battlefield, this army did not simply depart — it marched boldly into Okhema. At its head was Cerydra, who would later be known as the demigod of Law. She declared herself the city's supreme ruler, vowing to bring justice to its people. It was not long before she took drastic measures to purge the Council of Elders, silencing all opposition. Some called her a dictator, a tyrant, a despot — but none could deny that under her rule, Okhema swiftly regained its strength, laying the foundation for the prosperity it enjoys today.<br><br>████<i>Content missing, seemingly burned away.</i>████<br><br>Cerydra raised a vast army and conquered one city-state after another, while the swordmaster remained by her side, decapitating champions one by one. The Chrysos War dragged on until, at last, with the King of Corinth throwing himself from a window in despair, the conflict came to an end. Almost single-handedly, Cerydra and Hysilens had ended the Chrysos War, securing Cerydra's legacy as a ruler revered by all in the holy city.<br><br>As support for her grew among the populace, Cerydra issued an edict proclaiming the realization of Kephale's prophecy — the Era Nova. Her goal was to hunt the Titans and seize the Coreflames. She gathered an immense force of warriors, scholars, priests, and adventurers. Heroes from all corners of the land answered her call, their numbers outmatching the pillars of the Palace. This great campaign became known as the First Flame-Chase Journey. Yet none at the time foresaw that, a thousand years later, heroes would once again have to embark on the same path...<br><br>████<i>Content missing, seemingly burned away.</i>████<br><br>And so, the Flame-Chase Army met a bitter defeat. From that moment on, the once-wise Cerydra changed — she became obstinate, heedless of all counsel, and eventually vanished from the public eye entirely. It was only when the Goldweaver, Aglaea, rose to restore order that Okhema's political landscape stabilized once more. In recognition of Aglaea's wisdom and leadership, the Council of Elders appointed her as the new executor — a tradition that continues to this day.<br><br>However, I believe that Cerydra did not simply disappear, as the Council of Elders claims. Rather, she stepped into a grander scheme yet to be unveiled. The fact that the \"Law\" of Amphoreus remains unbroken to this day is the strongest evidence of her continued influence. As for the Dux Gladiorum Hysilens, some say she still walks the lands of Amphoreus, wielding the divine authority of the Ocean in solitude. The crashing waves against the shore — perhaps they are but the murmurs of her loneliness."

People have always been curious, how did this foreign-born youth who grew up impoverished manage to build an empire from scratch and carve out his legacy in Okhema? And whenever asked this question, Viotis would always mention that fateful disaster.<br><br><br><i>\"I have always believed that Talanton is fair to everyone.\"</i><br><i>by Viotis, Merchant Guild Representative</i><br><br><br>When Viotis was still a young boy, his homeland was consumed by the black tide, forcing him to flee alone to seek refuge with his compatriot brother, Atticus, in Okhema. However, Zagreus always took delight in tormenting the unfortunate. Along the way, Viotis was ambushed by bandits, with one blade piercing his chest and another slashing his arm. Fortunately, a passing hunter saved his life. Though he survived, the trauma left him with an ailment that troubled him for many years.<br><br><br><i>\"Embrace your flaws. Timely forgetting allows you to focus more on your goals.\"</i><br><i>by Viotis, Chief Benefactor of the Grove Amnesia Clinic</i><br><br><br>Viotis tumbled into a ravine and barely survived, but in doing so, he lost all his memories. When he was taken in and treated at the Twilight Courtyard, he could only mutter a single name \"Atticus.\" Following this clue, people managed to locate his elder brother, Atticus. The latter cared for him diligently, slowly recounting his experiences until his condition showed improvement.<br>Even after that, Viotis continued to suffer from amnesia. Perhaps because all his memories came from his brother's retelling, during episodes of his condition, he could no longer distinguish whether he was Atticus or Viotis.<br><br><br><i>\"Brotherly partnerships always end in separation. Throughout my journey, I have never relied on my brother's influence.\"</i><br><i>by Viotis, Licensed Supplier of the Kephale Sanctuary</i><br><br><br>Viotis's elder brother, Atticus, was already the most promising apprentice under the High Priest. After the High Priest's passing, Atticus succeeded him and announced the famous \"Prophecy of Eternal Day.\" However, Viotis did not seize the opportunity to accept a sacred position. Instead, he chose to forge his own path.<br>He rented a shop in the Marmoreal Market, working tirelessly for three years to save up ten thousand Balance Coins. With the addition of three hundred thousand Balance Coins from his brother Atticus's support, he was finally able to open his first pawnshop.<br><br><br><i>\"Integrity never leads to loss, and devotion brings profit.\"</i><br><i>by Viotis, Lifetime Guest of the Dawncloud</i><br><br><br>The turbulent times allowed Viotis to secure his first fortune through his pawnshop. He then organized trade caravans, monopolizing the timber and olive oil trade between city-states, amassing an inexhaustible wealth. Strangely, after his elder brother Atticus passed away prematurely due to illness, Viotis's amnesia worsened. In his delirium, he referred to himself as Atticus and could recite the Oracles of Kephale fluently.<br>This strange phenomenon led him to become a devout believer in the Titans. Every year, he set aside one-sixtieth of his profits as tribute to Kephale, a practice he upheld until his death."

Slowly, he raised his right arm, four fingers pressed together, and with a simple motion, he lightly waved at the colossal being before him.<br><br>\"Arrogant fool! You will pay the price for your insolence!\"<br><br>Aquila's fury erupted, their towering form radiating intense heat. In an instant, their massive wings vibrated at an imperceptible speed! A thousand razor-sharp feathers shot forth like swords, hurtling straight toward the God-King!<br><br>As everyone knows, the feathers of the Sky Titan can pierce through iron and steel, let alone mortal flesh. Their sheer density left no room to evade!<br><br>The violent storm of lethal blades closed in, and time itself seemed to freeze! Aquila enhanced their reflexes, predicting the movements of this arrogant little thief before them.<br><br>Noticing the God-King shifting his stance, Aquila mused, he had only two choices! He could push off the ground to evade left or right, or stand firm and brace for impact. But either way, it would be futile! The feathered blades would shift with the wind, altering their trajectory. No matter how swift his movements, they would follow him relentlessly!<br><br>But who could have predicted, the God-King never intended to dodge! He pushed forward instead, seizing the first incoming feather blade between two fingers. With a swift turn, he carved a spiral through the air and hurled it back at supersonic speed.<br><br>The feather blade curved with the wind, piercing deep into the storm. Without the slightest deviation, it collided tip-to-tip with another razor-sharp steel feather.<br><br>\"Ding!\"<br><br>The deflected feather veered to the sides upon impact, colliding with others and further altering their trajectories!<br><br>\"Ding!!!\"<br><br>The sharp clashing of feathers rang out in an irregular rhythm, a chain reaction unfolding until the force of the final feather was dissipated, scattering harmlessly into the air! With just a single seized feather, the God-King had nullified the entire storm of blade-like wings!<br><br>Aquila was shocked! How could a mere mortal possess such divine skill?<br>Yet, as a being of godly essence, they did not allow themself to be shaken. Seizing the moment as the scattered feathers clouded their vision, they swiftly brought down their claws, sharp as steel greatswords, aiming to end the battle in a single decisive strike!<br><br>\"Boom!!\"<br><br>The massive claw struck dead center where the God-King stood, the sheer force of impact carving a deep crater into the ground!<br>No... something felt off. Aquila's mind raced, this sensation was strange... Had it missed? Or—<br>They focused their gaze, only to witness the impossible. Their enormous, razor-sharp claw, many times larger than the God-King himself, was caught, held effortlessly in a single hand, as if the God-King were merely grasping a piece of cutlery!<br><br>The countless white feathers drifting through the air painted an eerie contrast against the battlefield's deadly stillness. The once-mighty and untouchable giant eagle found itself frozen in shock, for the first time in a thousand years. Muttering in disbelief, they said:<br><br>\"Impossible! Even Georios, when fighting me, could do nothing but evade beneath my iron claws, yet you... what in the world ARE you!!!\"<br><br>\"Haven't you already figured out the answer? A mere mortal, nothing more.\"<br><br>\"You cocky little—!!!\"<br><br>Aquila attempted to retract their claw, but under the God-King's grip, it was as if frozen in place, completely immobile. Their expression darkened.<br><br>Seeing this, the God-King seemed to smile. He clenched the fingers of his free hand and then, at a speed even a Titan's vision could not perceive...<br><br>With full force, he swung his fist.<br><br>\"Boom!!!!\"<br><br>In an instant, the divine body shattered!<br><br>A tidal wave of force shook the heavens, sending tremors through the divine steel-forged walls, cracking them in multiple places. The sacred temple teetered on the brink of collapse!<br><br>From this moment on, the celestial realm would exist no more! The people of Amphoreus would no longer endure the tyranny of the heavens! And all of this was made possible by the God-King's mighty blows, no, by a single punch!<br><br>The distant Titan gods sensed the fall of their comrade and erupted into furious howls. Was there no one who could stop him? How could his advance ever be shaken??<br><br>What they did not realize was that even one as mighty as the God-King was still bound by the desires of mortals.<br><br>Just as before the battle began, he once again adjusted his attire.<br><br>\"...Congratulations, you have reached your end, Aquila. You are strong, strong enough to be worthy of the name Sky Titan.\"<br><br>He ignored the crumbling stone walls behind him and strode toward the temple's exit. His steps were steady, yet the disappointment on his face was unmistakable.<br><br>\"But your only flaw, was failing to make this satisfying for me.\"<br><br><br>Next Episode: \"Battling Nikador\" (Next issue on hiatus)"

And what was it that Aglaea had promised us? The World Wound Web was supposed to be a network for sharing knowledge, a great platform for openness, equality, collaboration, and sharing. But what was the reality? Bad information drove out the good, and we weren't just drowning people's senses with garbage data; we were using the platform to stir up endless arguments. I once voiced my confusion to Kephale, but they just remained silent. If things keep going this way, what kind of fate awaits us at the end of this digital torrent? Speed is no ally of civilization — it's just a beast that devours humanity!<br><br>However, I must clarify one thing — although, like many others, I voted against Ms. Aglaea at the citizens' assembly, I still believe she was an honest and upright person. I would think that even the public servants from the Council of Elders who spoke out for us would agree: she was merely a tragic blind soul, oblivious to reality, walking alone in her fantasy world.<br><br>Of course, it's unfortunate that Ms. Aglaea has passed. But as I write this, the World Wound Web, now severed from the golden thread, transmits information at a rate measured in bytes per second — and this suddenly makes me feel like life has returned to reality. I brewed a cup of tea, reading <i>The Kings of Kremnos</i> with interest, while waiting for the audiobook of <i>The Adventures of Dolos the Thief</i> to finish downloading. Yesterday, I would have found this unbearably slow-paced. But now, after we've truly lost the golden thread, and the World Wound Web no longer has any advantage over Flying Amphora in speed... I find myself regaining balance in life, rediscovering inner peace.<br><br>In terms of commercial ads, the World Wound Web may already be dead. But in my heart, it has just been reborn.

History is nothing more than the consensus of the living about the past. If a certain piece of history, by its very existence, causes harm to people... then those who choose to forget it should not be condemned as fools or cowards.<br><br>Daythunder Knight Seliose, usurper of Aquila's divine authority, Theos Synthetos of the sky. Such an incredibly powerful figure, and yet when she was a young girl, freshly cast out from the Skyfolk, she was nothing more than an ordinary girl forced into isolation. Within the large family, factional disputes were inevitable, and indeed, quarrels between the Sunfolk and the Rainfolk were frequent. But for the young Seliose, her true trouble lay in the fact that she bled golden blood.<br><br>Golden blood was both a mark of divine strength and a curse of being \"other.\" The young girl grew weary of living a life where she constantly had to prove herself to others, so she embarked on a journey of wandering. In the silent wilderness, she encountered Lunabis and Solabis — beings unlike humans, with whom she quickly built trust, hunting, growing, and living together, taking them as her teachers to learn their arts and expanding her horizons.<br><br>True to her golden blood, after many years of study far from home, the young girl had grown into the unparalleled Daythunder Knight, and even Aquila in the sky dared not ignore her wings. Perhaps deep inside, she never wished to be a lonely paragon, or maybe her childhood ideal of saving the Skyfolk had never left her heart. Whatever the reason, as a powerful outsider, she returned to the tribes of the Skyfolk and declared that she would strike down Aquila — the Titan who was weak and cowardly — so that people's lives could enter a new stage, one filled with hope.<br><br>I often wonder... What if the Daythunder Knight hadn't desired to save the Skyfolk? Would things have turned out differently if she had simply struck down Aquila because she wanted to, without inviting her fellows — those who were so far apart from her in spirit — to share the victory? ...Could many of the tragedies that followed have been avoided? Perhaps the Skyfolk could have continued their old way of life, finding solace in the fallen Aquila. And perhaps, for the Daythunder Knight, letting them continue on their own path wouldn't have been much of a loss.<br><br>Unfortunately, history has no \"what ifs.\" In my estimation, the Daythunder Knight's true wish may have been for all the Skyfolk to become proud and solitary knights like her. She sincerely wanted to love everyone equally using that lofty standard. But reality cruelly proved that, rather than becoming spiritual nobility, most Skyfolk were more disposed to become those of \"no-ability.\" The more she despised Aquila, the more some began to worship her in the same way the previous generations had worshiped Aquila — except for the wording of their mottoes, nothing really differed.<br><br>As an outsider, she could only use extreme violence to control the very people she sought to save... much like a parent who, accustomed to hitting their children, can only express their distorted love through domestic violence (at least in her understanding, this was indeed a form of love).<br><br><i>(The following text also shows signs of having been erased and rewritten.)</i><br><br>When this brief biography was originally written, the situation wasn't yet beyond saving. But after today... I will be the last of the Skyfolk, and according to the agreement with her, I will search for new meaning for the history she has written in the future.<br><br>I don't know if I (or my descendants) will ever complete this mission...

In those distant times, we lived within the celestial mural, divided into the Sunfolk, Rainfolk, and Winterfolk. The Sunfolk wielded the blazing sun, representing honor; the Rainfolk controlled thunder and rain, symbolizing power; and the Winterfolk guarded frost and snow, embodying wisdom. Each tribe had its role, serving the great Aquila together.<br><br>But beneath the skies, not all was harmonious. The Sunfolk believed that only the sun could banish the darkness of the world. They pursued power and glory, viewing other tribes as weak and cowardly. The Rainfolk were convinced that only thunder could purify the filth, often using violent methods to oppose outsiders. The Winterfolk, wise as they were, often earned the resentment of others due to their arrogance and stubbornness. The tensions between the three tribes gradually grew deeper, almost to the point that reconciliation seemed impossible.<br><br>Until the catastrophe came.<br><br>Seliose challenged the sky itself, and the celestial mural was torn asunder. Countless Skykin perished in the eternal night, and the survivors were forced to flee their homeland, concealing themselves upon the earth. Amidst this catastrophe, a sage with golden blood led the survivors of the three tribes to safety. She understood that the divisions between the tribes had brought ruin upon the Skykin, and so swore an oath: To establish a sanctuary that could harmonize the sun and the moon, blending the dawn and dusk. This was the origin of Twilight Courtyard.<br><br>Unlike other city-states, the Twilight Courtyard never chose to settle in one place. They knew that to heal the rifts between tribes and mend old grievances, they could not remain confined to one corner of the world. So, the members of the Courtyard became wandering healers, astrologers, and scholars, traveling across the land of Amphoreus. They used the blessings of the sky bestowed by Aquila to help the people, all while seeking the possibility of returning to the sky.<br><br>Though the Courtyard no longer held the former glory of the Skykin, it retained many important traditions. Every time a child in the tribe turned eight, a Sky Rite would be held. During this ancient ceremony, the child would resonate with one of four divine objects: the Sun Crown, the Storm Bracelet, the Ice Ring, or the Radiant Pendant. The first three were passed down through the bloodlines of the Sunfolk, Rainfolk, and Winterfolk, while the Radiant Pendant symbolized harmony beyond division. It's said that over the centuries, only a few have resonated with the Radiant Pendant.<br><br>After the Chrysos War erupted, the Twilight Courtyard's situation grew ever more dire. Their nomadic lifestyle made them appear weak in the eyes of various factions. The warriors of Castrum Kremnos especially despised these exiles, often launching raids against them. While the Courtyard had once allied with forces like Okhema and the Grove of Epiphany, the calling that coursed through their veins always pushed them to abandon stability in search of the revelations that would lead them back to the sky.<br><br>In these turbulent times, the Twilight Courtyard has held firm to its founding ideals: to resolve enmity through healing and end conflicts through harmony. Though the outside world mocks them for their weakness, the members of the Courtyard have always believed that only by reconciling opposition and embracing differences can they prevent repeating past mistakes. This belief has endured to this day, becoming the Twilight Courtyard's most treasured legacy.<br><br>...<br><br>[The rest is missing]"

But today, as I find myself with a rare moment of leisure, I want to capture those stories passed down through our family, leaving them as a keepsake for you.<br><br>Did you know? Our ancestors also had places much like the Okhema market. In the twilight corridors where day and night met, people from different tribes gathered to exchange goods. The Sunfolk brought sun-dried cloud wool, the finest material for weaving fabric; the Rainfolk sold condensed thunder dew, which, when applied to the skin, was said to make it glow; and the Winterfolk traded their special ice crystal candies, which dissolved slowly on the tongue, with a sweetness that lingered all day long.<br><br>As a child, I was most captivated by the tales of these markets. Your grandmother often spoke of them, not only for the trade but for the spontaneous performances on the cloud platforms. The most popular were the Winter Tribe singers, who could make the falling snowflakes dance in time with their songs. The Rainfolk, too, were experts at using the rhythm of thunder to accompany their melodies, perfectly in tune with the storm.<br><br>...<br><br>Our traditional meals were far more exciting than those of Okhema. Each tribe had its own unique customs: the Sunfolk held midday Sun Feasts, where they used specially crafted crystal vessels to refract the sunlight, roasting food to a golden perfection; the Rainfolk, on the other hand, only ate when the thunderstorm arrived, believing that the air was freshest then, and even the simplest cloudsheep milk tasted heavenly.<br><br>But the most distinctive was the Winterfolk's Coldwoods Tea Party. They set long tables beneath trees covered in icy flowers, sipping tea brewed from starlight. The liquid was clear when poured, but as the temperature shifted, the tea would change colors. Our family has a favorite joke: Once, a Rainfolk got so excited at a tea party that one sneeze turned all the tea into frozen columns.<br><br>...<br><br>Like you, the children loved to play. But their games were very different from those on the ground. The most beloved game was Lightchasing, where children divided into teams and chased each other through the dancing shadows and beams of sunlight between the clouds. The children of Sunfolk were the fastest runners, but the Rainfolk kids excelled at finding shortcuts, while the Winterfolk children were known for their unexpected, strategic moves.<br><br>Another game was called Kite Dancing, where participants glided through the clouds with the wind. It was not only fun but an essential training to master the art of controlling air. Your grandfather used to say he was quite skilled at this game when he was young. He once flew across three layers of clouds in a single breath, winning admiration from all.<br><br>...<br><br>Whenever Aquila's light shone brightest, our ancestors would celebrate with a grand Skylight Festival. All the tribes would lay aside their differences and gather together in joyous union. The Sunfolk would weave ribbons of radiant light, the Rainfolk would fashion beautiful, rainbow-colored cloud bridges, and the Winterfolk would let shimmering snowflakes fall from the heights. The entire mural would be bathed in a dazzling array of colors, a sight so breathtaking it could leave you speechless.<br><br>But the most exciting event is the annual Dawn and Dusk Festival. It's a celebration dedicated to the rising sun and setting moon, and an important occasion for different peoples to gather together. Everyone brings their favorite foods, shares funny stories from the previous year, and puts on performances. The Sunfolk often showcase their light-weaving skills, making sunlight dance between their fingers; the Rainfolk perform the Thunder Dance, moving in sync with the rhythm of thunder; and finally, the Winterfolk bring up the rear, playing their ice crystal instruments, the sound of which is said to resonate throughout the entire sky.<br><br>As I write this, I can't help but recall what your grandmother always said: Though we now live on the ground, if you just look up at the sky, you can still feel the blessings of our ancestors.<br><br>Maybe one day, when Aquila's scars are healed, we'll return to our home among the clouds. But until then, let us cherish the life we have now and remember these stories — they're our treasured heritage.<br><br>Love you always, Mom"

Yet it was this very opportunity that began to shake my belief in Aquila's true nature.<br><br>We, the Sunfolk, have always believed that Aquila favors us. After all, of all the Skykin, only we are capable of enduring the harshest sunlight. We saw this as the Titan's special favor, even looking down on the other Kin. But when I ventured deep into the mural and witnessed the true nature of the Titan's actions, everything changed.<br><br>At the heart of the mural, there stood a vast mirror reflecting Aquila's hundred eyes watching the earth. On that day, I witnessed a group of devout worshipers praying, beseeching Aquila to bless their harvest. Yet the Titan remained indifferent, its gaze always fixed on the distant, creeping black tide. As the black mist approached, Aquila instinctively turned their eyes skyward, as though trying to flee from something terrifying.<br><br>In that moment, everything became clear. Aquila's favor was not due to an affinity for us, the Sunfolk, but rather their attempt to escape the ever-advancing black tide below. We mistook the Titan's fear for favor, taking pride in what was, in fact, their flight from danger. Even more tragically, they paid no heed to the prayers of the worshipers, viewing their devotions as little more than the dancing of ants.<br><br>I began to notice other details. Whenever a city-state fell, Aquila's pupils would contract ever so slightly—but not out of sorrow. They were calculating the spread of the black tide. From their lofty perch in the heavens, they coldly observed all things. Even the light they bestowed was merely to illuminate their own path, enabling them to track the advance of the black tide.<br><br>One night, I stood once more before the mural. The faithful were singing their praises, hailing the sun and light, singing of Aquila's benevolence. But in that instant, I saw a flicker of disdain in Aquila's eyes. They despised these weak, fragile creatures, just as they feared the darkness that loomed below. In their skies, there was neither compassion nor truth — only an eternal paradox. They were the ruler of light, yet the most cowardly of fugitives.<br><br>The cruelest irony is that, even as I pen these words, I can still feel Aquila's gaze upon me. Yet I know they will not punish me for my blasphemy. To them, my betrayal is no more significant than the worship of their followers. Perhaps it is this very indifference that constitutes their true divinity.<br><br><i>Postscript: This manuscript was discovered in a corner of ████████, believed to be the work of ██████.

Even among common trades, remarkable individuals have had their deeds recorded by historians. Priests named by {RUBY_B#Sky Titan}Aquila{RUBY_E#}, blacksmiths blessed by {RUBY_B#Earth Titan}Georios{RUBY_E#}, and even ascetics permitted by {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} have all had their lives chronicled. Only those who serve {RUBY_B#Trickery Titan}Zagreus{RUBY_E#}, who corrupt law with lies and violate rules through deception, yet still dare to boast of their abilities and virtues, are universally condemned. For all their deviations from the path of honor, they are particularly despised by the people of Kremnos.<br><br>I, Ptolemy, having consumed every word and symbol in the archives of Castrum Kremnos, have never encountered any written chronicle of the kin of the god of thieves. Yet while traveling through various states with the king of the Kremnoan detachment, I kept hearing tales of the three hundred rogues of Dolos.<br><br>Dolos, the city of thieves, situated south of Janusopolis and north of the Grove of Epiphany, operates under different laws than elsewhere, making it fertile ground for trickery and deception. Legend says that a thousand years ago, the first Chrysos War concluded with the total defeat of the Chrysos Heir forces. Later, when the Chrysos War reignited, various states again plunged into desperate poverty. The Dolos nobility seized this opportunity to accumulate wealth, then issued anti-fraud decrees to monopolize the city's financial channels, creating dire circumstances for ordinary citizens. To survive, many common thieves departed for other lands, using their talents to deceive people and steal goods. In total, men and women, young and old, approximately three hundred gained renown, becoming known as the \"Three Hundred Rogues of Dolos.\"<br><br>I believe these three hundred are called \"rogues\" (rather than thieves or criminals) because, though their actions constitute theft, they possess a heroic spirit. Though they lack honor, they demonstrate either the resilience of self-sacrifice or the appearance of courage. Therefore, I dedicate some portion of my writings to compiling their exploits into this collection.<br><br>...<br><br><b><i>First of the Three Hundred Rogues, \"The Thousand-Faced\" Hirendou</i></b><br>The true appearance and identity of Hirendou cannot be determined with certainty. Some rumors describe a delicate woman skilled in disguise, others suggest a thin man with a versatile voice, and some even claim this person was a Chrysos Heir. However, most oral histories agree that this individual was the first rogue to leave Dolos for other states. Tales of their exploits circulated throughout Aenionus, the Grove of Epiphany, and Odressian. Hirendou excelled at creating false identities to deceive others, and particularly enjoyed repeatedly tricking the same person with different disguises — typically targeting wealthy nobles of questionable character.<br><br>...<br><br>In the \"Dolos' Great Ruse Against Gods,\" Hirendou journeyed alone to the northern city-state of Loukas where, using one hundred different identities, they engineered the release of a thousand innocent prisoners from the cruel tyrant's dungeon. Eventually captured, Hirendou was sentenced to beheading. However, on the execution day, after the executioner's blade fell, spectators were astonished to discover that the severed head belonged to the tyrant himself. Hirendou, who had been disguised as the ruler on the viewing platform, removed their mask and calmly departed amid the spontaneous protection provided by the crowd. To escape imprisonment through one's own ingenuity was rare even among the Three Hundred Rogues.<br><br>...<br><br><b><i>Ninety-seventh of the Three Hundred Rogues, \"Bladed Black Velvet\" Ferrum</i></b><br>Bladed Black Velvet, also known as the Steelclaw Beast, resembles a large mole. Skilled at tunneling, its claws possess unmatched hardness, capable of severing finely crafted weapons with a single swipe. It often creates massive, irreparable thief tunnels at the base of city walls. Hunting the Steelclaw Beast alone has been a coming-of-age ritual preserved for centuries by certain Kremnoan families.<br><br>Ferrum, known for their appearance and methods, earned this infamous nickname. Their portrait survives through the ages, showing a dark face, rough beard, and powerful arms, with hands twice the size of an average man's. Ferrum is skilled in wielding two folding spades and is often seen wearing arm guards. Though not one for words, Ferrum's ancestors were the Georios priests of Hattusili, with an exceptional understanding of soil and geology. Legend has it that Ferrum could dig a tunnel several thousand steps long within two days, bypassing stubborn rocks and reaching the treasure vault of the aristocrats with precision.<br><br>...<br><br>In the \"Dolos' Great Ruse Against Gods,\" Ferrum ventured to Mythemis, spending ten days digging a tunnel connecting the homes of eight aristocrats in the city, ending at the king's treasury. By the time the king noticed, Ferrum had already made off with more than half the treasure. Though Ferrum was captured and imprisoned, the treasure mysteriously vanished. The king and aristocrats confiscated Ferrum's spades and locked him away in a cube-shaped steel prison underground. About half a month later, the treasure from Mythemis appeared in the hands of the common folk across various city-states.<br><br>...<br><br><b><i>The 235th to 238th of the 300 Rogues: The \"Fearfool Birds\" — The Four Perla Sisters</i></b><br><br>The Fearfool Birds, also known as Dulu birds, were once a species of social birds living on the outskirts of Oleinus. They usually moved in groups of four, unable to fly but skilled at gliding, and would feign death when attacked, waiting for the chance to escape in different directions. During the famine of the Chrysos War, this species became extinct due to being easy to capture.<br><br>The Four Perla Sisters were naturally clever, and it's said that even when fully grown, they remained the size of fledglings. They often appeared together on trade routes, tricking travelers into showing them sympathy. However, those who showed kindness to the four sisters often found treasure in their bags upon parting, while those who rudely drove them away faced repeated harassment along the way and eventually lost a great deal of wealth.<br><br>...<br><br>In the Dolos' Great Ruse Against Gods, the Four Perla Sisters first split up, each taking a separate route along the four main trade paths to deceive independently. They planned to meet again in a few days, but they failed to do so. One is said to have died, another was imprisoned, the third became disabled, and the fourth disappeared without a trace.<br><br>..."

She often wore a hooded cloak and was commonly referred to as the \"Lying Cat Cipher\" or \"Swift-Footed Cifera.\" Later generations often don't count her among the 300 Rogues because by the time she gained prominence, the 300 had already become legends, and her career as a swindler and thief only spanned around twenty years by the time the great ruse against gods was accomplished.<br><br>Cifera's story, as this author recounts it, is simply astounding: A young woman, practically unknown compared to the other rogues, managed to unite the 300 and pull off the great ruse against gods, even earning the divine authority of \"Trickery.\" Was this all truly fate as foretold in prophecy?<br><br>Since Cifera claimed the divine authority of Zagreus, nearly 900 years have passed. The records of the \"Dolos' Great Ruse Against Gods\" are unclear, largely because the Chrysos War was raging at the time and every state was preoccupied with its survival, leaving little time to track a Coreflame of the Calamity Titans, and making everyone focus on the Flame-Chase Journey. However, some bards who were there witnessed the entire \"Spirit Day\" deception feast and later recorded it in poetry, passing it down through the generations.<br><br>...<br><br>After deciding to seize the Coreflame of Zagreus, Cifera set off with her legendary steps that could cover a thousand miles a day, searching for the scattered 300 Rogues across Amphoreus. Among them, 103 rogues volunteered when they heard of the upcoming great ruse against gods; 87 were in Dolos, and Cifera spent a month visiting each, persuading them; 65 had returned to their ancestral homes, and Cifera spent five months visiting and convincing them; 19 were imprisoned, two faced execution, and Cifera, with the help of the \"Goldweaver,\" used diplomatic means to rescue them; finally, 26 were missing, and it took Cipher two years and five months to find them all.<br><br>...<br><br>In the end, it took four years and seven months for all 301 rogues to gather in Dolos on the eve of Spirit Day. After a brief mobilization and discussion, the next day, with the help of the \"gatekeeper,\" the rogues scattered across various city-states, each executing the trick they had most longed to try but never dared. What each of them accomplished is recorded in their individual biographies.<br><br>Zagreus, in their true form, only appears on Spirit Day, drawn to masterful deceptions. The events of Spirit Day led to the near-imprisonment of all 300 rogues, but also brought forth the infamous God of Thieves. This Trickery Titan was delighted by the feast of lies, taking the opportunity to mock every rogue caught in the snares of the law. When Cifera, the 301st rogue, was finally captured, Zagreus revealed themself to her in the final moments before Curtain-Fall Hour at the Spirit Day. Zagreus knew she had gone to great lengths to orchestrate this Spirit Day feast, all to summon them into the open. Now, Zagreus had come as promised, but how could a mere mortal like Cifera ever hope to defeat a god of trickery?<br><br>Yet, the instant the god of thieves appeared, Aglaea the Goldweaver, who had long been waiting in ambush, swiftly ensnared Zagreus with a golden thread of truth. Zagreus, attempting to use the divine power of lies to vanish, soon found that its fabrications had no place to hide before the unyielding golden thread. It turned out that Cifera and Aglaea had devised the entire scheme, using the prophecy of the demigod, Tribios, to predict the god of thieves' appearance. Aglaea executed the capture, and in the end, Cifera seized the opportunity to kill Zagreus and claim the Coreflame.<br><br>Thus, the Dolos' Great Ruse Against Gods was completed. Following the Spirit Day feast, Cifera used cunning to lift Dolos's ban on deception. Historical records state that she returned to Okhema with Aglaea the Goldweaver, and through the Coreflame trial, became a demigod of \"Trickery,\" with occasional sightings of her even to this day.<br><br>As for the 300 Rogues of Dolos, some say they perished in prison, while others claim they were rescued by Cifera through the divine power of \"Trickery,\" with most living out peaceful lives. Regardless, after the great ruse against gods, the 300 Rogues disappeared, their tales fading into obscurity. Just as the end of a Kremnos hero's journey is crowned with ascension to the throne, for a mere thief, ending a life of trickery with a great ruse against gods is no ignoble fate.<br><br>..."

Perhaps someday, someone will need to understand how we lost the light. Though, reflecting on it now, that once-ordinary brilliance already seems like a distant dream...<br><br>When did the first strange sign appear? I can't quite remember now, but I recall that roughly three months ago, while organizing materials in my study, I suddenly heard a commotion outside my window. People were running into the streets, pointing skyward and talking urgently. When I looked up, I noticed Aquila's radiance trembling — alternating between brightness and dimness, flickering several times before returning to its normal glow. It did appear slightly dimmer than before, though one would hardly notice without careful attention.<br><br>Later... messages arrived from distant places. My students reported that their world had been plunged into darkness. Soon after, the darkness spread like ink expelled from an octopus. While at the baths, I overheard a grain vendor explaining that his crops had begun withering due to insufficient light.<br><br>Most unsettling of all... is the silence from priests who serve ██████. In the past, faithful worshipers would frequently receive responses after praying to it. But this time, no matter how fervently the priests prayed, there was no answer — had I not been acquainted with ██████, I would never have learned of this classified information.<br><br>Until yesterday, when the catastrophe finally descended, and Okhema's doom became inevitable...<br><br>I awakened at Entry Hour with my heart pounding unexpectedly. The market outside was unusually crowded, with everyone staring skyward — above Okhema, Aquila's light quivered like my restless eyelids. I struggled desperately to keep my eyes open, yet found myself helplessly closing them. The atmosphere in the streets grew intensely somber. Some began weeping, while others prayed frantically to Aquila. I saw a child tugging at their mother's clothing, asking what was happening, but the mother remained speechless — only holding her child closely.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, the final light vanished — Aquila had closed their eyes completely. A chorus of lamentations echoed through the streets. Just as everyone believed Evernight had descended upon us, a golden light suddenly illuminated the sky above the holy city. It was the Dawn Device. The Chaplain of Dawncloud proclaimed to everyone that this was Kephale's blessing, which would shine upon Okhema forever, never ceasing.<br><br>Though its brilliance cannot match Aquila's radiance, it at least provides us with a ray of hope. While everyone firmly believes what ███████ proclaimed, I harbor doubts — how could we possibly expect a machine to rival the divine power of a Titan?<br><br>Of course, I wouldn't dare voice such thoughts publicly...<br><br>At Parting Hour, I noticed numerous lights throughout the city for the first time as neighbors lit their candles and torches. Everyone fears the approaching darkness, yet those flames are so small — a gentle breeze could extinguish them, as fragile as our hearts. I don't know how long we must endure these conditions. My friend, Astrologist ██████, reports observing unusual celestial phenomena, as if something terrible approaches Aquila. Yet none of us dare speak openly. The priests claim to have received a \"prophecy,\" and if we were caught privately concerning ourselves with ████████, we would surely face...<br><br>Having written this much, I find myself at a loss for words. I've secured this diary with three separate locks, hoping it remains undiscovered. I pray that when my child reads these words after growing up, the world will have reclaimed its eternal light. I hear commotion outside — with today's tremendous upheaval, many parts of the city have suffered. I still don't know how my youngest sister, who lives farthest away, is faring... May the Titans protect us all."

                "Desc": "<i><u>Internal use only, do not distribute</u></i><br><br>Hey sailor, ever been to IPC's space military academy? No? Well, it makes no difference.<br><br>Considering we always get some <s>illiterates</s> (Editorial: those awaiting education) from frontier worlds on board, we should explain how modern space combat works and what sort of opponents we're up against.<br><br>The history of human warfare is a story of ever-growing toys: from armor and swords to vehicles and guns, then to warships and giant cannons... No matter how soldiers' equipment expanded, victory was always determined by humans. However, at cosmic scales, most battles are decided before they begin — just by calculating equipment standards, it's easy to predict which way victory will lean, with gaps sometimes greater than between humans and insects.<br><br>In space, range, accuracy, and speed form an impossible triangle — no entity can excel in all three (Editorial note: except Emanators). Thus, warships follow two main attack strategies: close in for precision strikes, or overwhelm opponents with massive and indiscriminate area attacks. Space pirates often take a more direct approach: boarding and bringing the fight to familiar territory — hand-to-hand combat requires less brainpower than calculating trajectories and routes, plus they get a free ship if they win.<br><br><b>Interastral Peace Corporation</b><br><br>Without silver rails, Pathstriders still have some inefficient or dangerous travel methods. While these might connect several star sectors, they can't establish a vast and efficient cosmic market. Thus, the IPC fleet's main duty is protecting and maintaining existing silver rails, sometimes also undertaking planetary landings and securing key points. Most warships carry a complement of mechs and drop pods to support ground forces after securing orbit.<br><br>IPC warships favor energy weapons, with positron cannons, annihilation beams, and Imaginary fission cannons standard even on frigates. Our fleet also possesses the universe's strongest shield technology, colored like the Amber Lord's holy form. The Marketing Development Department's six fleets are each valued \"worth a rank P46 employee.\"<br><br>Recently, the Intelligentsia Guild completed modifications on a Genius Society invention, naming it the \"#77 Puzzle Cannon.\" It triggers explosions directly at target locations, requiring no flight time or accuracy concerns — a perfect weapon. However, still in testing, the device remains too large for all but the biggest ships to carry.<br><br><b>Antimatter Legion</b><br><br>Most Antimatter Legion members can cross stars without ships. But for expeditions, they use \"Borehole Blitz\" transport vessels as planetary invasion platforms. These ships drill destructive tunnels through Imaginary barriers for forced passage. Unlike silver rails, these tunnels are extremely dangerous, unusable by non-Legion forces, and sometimes leak Imaginary energy. Ships attempting Borehole travel are like threading through a tooth-lined gullet — facing near-certain death. When Blitz ships close in, Voidrangers and Tramplers can teleport past shields directly to our bridges, overwhelming even ship-based mech forces.<br><br>In fleet battles, Celenova the Lord Ravager is undoubtedly the most fearsome opponent. Even common Voidrangers cause terrible destruction under her command. Surviving captains report her fleets show uncanny coordination, meshing like perfect gears, even executing theoretical tactics — considering communication delays and troop morale, our fleets could never achieve such precise cooperation.<br><br>Recent cases show Celenova possesses intergalactic command abilities, potentially intervening even in frigate-level encounters. When facing Legion forces under Celenova, units must first determine if she or her avatar is aboard the flagship: if so, prioritize decapitation strikes (though this won't eliminate her permanently, it temporarily disrupts her command). If not, focus on intercepting approaching Blitz ships and prepare for retreat.<br><br><b>The Xianzhou Alliance</b><br><br>The Xianzhou Alliance fleet underwent two reforms, now a vast mix of organic and mechanical vessels. While little intelligence exists about their main warships, more notable is a multipurpose vehicle called the \"starskiff.\"<br><br>Take the closely allied Yaoqing: their starskiff technology seems similar to borisin mechabeast ships, each bred through biotechnology. Using pilot genetic data as keys, the ship's performance and interface details perfectly match pilot habits, like a custom-made second body.<br><br>At sufficient tonnage, these starskiffs can even replace pilots in judgment and action. The Intelligentsia Guild believes such vessels should be considered organisms — their relationship with pilots isn't just machines with operators, but hunters with hounds.<br><br><b>Planet Screwllum</b><br><br>The Anti-Organic Equation may no longer pose a threat, yet given how the two Emperor's Wars ravaged the known universe, all units must remain vigilant against the Intellitrons — though such caution should remain discreet.<br><br>Planet Screwllum now stands as the face of Intellitron power, its fleet embodying their philosophy: evolution over creation. Through augmentation, individual Intellitrons transform seamlessly into combat vessels of any scale, commanding their weapons with instinctive precision. Unlike Cloud Knights who can dismount from Xianzhou starskiffs post-battle, augmented Intellitrons become one with their warship forms.<br><br>To Intellitrons, physical form bears no impact on their identity — regardless of the extent of modification or damage. This significantly reduces their maintenance costs. One day, they may abandon these humanoid shells worn for social acceptance, forcing us to unearth our long-buried arsenals."

The rumor you mentioned does have some truth to it.<br>Interviewer: So you're saying that, whether or not the Cleaner Order actually does this, at least the method isn't entirely nonsense?<br>Expert: Human skills, knowledge... they can all be considered types of memory. And with Oronyx's miracles, we may have a way to convert memories into a tangible form... though \"spine made of mysterious metals\" sounds unbelievable, bones or prosthetics could certainly serve as a medium for such miracles.<br>Interviewer: So, with the help of alchemy and miracles, memories could truly be made eternal?<br>Expert: In theory, yes. But only the memories. This method can't resurrect the dead. It's just a form of \"substitution\" at best.<br>Interviewer: Sorry, what do you mean by that?<br>Expert: For example, even if I possess my mother's memories and can recall stories of her honeymoon with my father... it doesn't mean I have become my mother.<br>Interviewer: Ah, I see.<br>Interviewer: But if there were an organization that valued not its members' lives, but their skills, secrets, or even emotional attachments like love or hatred... then using this method to pass on those qualities would make sense, right?<br>Expert: Exactly.<br>Interviewer: I see, thank you for the fascinating explanation!"

                "Desc": "To Her Majesty, Queen of Styxia: What We Know About Death<br><br><i>Your Majesty, Queen of Styxia,</i><br><br>Your Majesty, I've received your letter from a few days ago. Truly, as you have stated, the immortal Golden Age has become a thing of the past since the birth of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} on Amphoreus. I believe that we shall never return to that era again.<br><br>I am aware that the faith in \"death\" held by Aidonians is viewed with trepidation by other city-states. This is not difficult to comprehend, for the aversion to \"death\" may stem from a deeper logic inherent to life itself. In your letter, you expressed a desire to understand \"death\" and sought my thoughts on the \"torment of immortality.\" I am truly humbled by your request. I am aware that immortals and mortals perceive the world very differently, and I am uncertain if any counsel I can offer is worthy of one who has witnessed all the ages. But since you seek an answer, then an answer I will attempt to produce, with my reflections on the topic.<br><br>In essence, I would summarize it as thus: <i>It is because all things must end one day that all things gain meaning, and therein lies the meaning of life.</i> This is why we devote ourselves to \"death\" and revere it. It is a simple yet complicated concept. If this intrigues you, then please allow me to elaborate further.<br><br>In Aidonia, we offer blessings to our children every year, congratulating them for taking another step toward \"death.\" We hold various ceremonies and holidays (such as their coming-of-age rites) to commemorate every special and pivotal moment in life, for we know that what has passed may never manifest again in our fleeting existence. We make heartfelt farewells to our loved ones at departure, wish for one more tomorrow with each other at the end of the day, and whisper goodnight before we are taken by our nightly dreaming.<br><br>We grieve our losses, and consequently, rejoice in our gains. We learn how to cherish things this way, and from this cherish comes bliss, even if this bliss is fleeting for immortals. Yes, this may sound absurd, but it is true nonetheless: It is \"death\" that brings us joy.<br><br>But for you and all immortals who lived through the Golden Age, there is a world of difference.<br><br>For instance, I heard that in Styxia, there are never solemn ceremonies or holidays, or even anything that could be described as \"reverent,\" \"elegiac,\" or \"commemorative,\" because such things are unnecessary. In the long span of immortality, nothing is of great import, and thus, nothing is worth commemorating. To immortals, all actions and thoughts are but echoes from a distant past, destined to reverberate into the future eternal.<br><br>As the saying goes, <i>\"There is nothing new under the sun. All novelty springs from forgetfulness.\"</i> I believe that, for the immortals who have experienced everything and must continue to experience everything, all things are but dull and tasteless relics. If there are things to be considered \"entertaining\" by the immortals, they are surely beyond the understanding of us mortals bound by death.<br><br>I believe by now the answer is made clear: To escape the \"torment of immortality\" you mentioned in your letter, the answer I offer is \"death.\" From the moment {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} first walked the lands of Amphoreus, philosophers have argued that \"immortality\" is but a curse, and that extending life, in essence, is but repeating the mundane. In fact, those who held such views may have been the founders of Aidonia itself.<br><br>Under the threat of \"death,\" we weigh every choice carefully, for each choice implies something \"irreversible\" and \"irrecoverable.\" Some philosophers once suggested that our lives exist in a state of \"eternal cycle,\" meaning every choice you make is infinitely magnified in this eternal cycle, and even the smallest deviation can alter your life therein. I imagine it to be difficult for an immortal to empathize with the unbearable weight implied.<br><br>We know that the moments we experience are not eternal, nor can they even be considered segments of eternity. They are but fleeting illusions. Every action in this delicate life can be our last, and every face will blur and fade like those seen once upon a dream.<br><br>Therefore, Your Majesty, if you ask me my understanding of \"death,\" then permit me to define it with my understanding of \"life,\" for they are one and the same. And in this journey of life, \"death\" is not our final destination, rather, a piece of luggage we must carry. If confusion still troubles you, please do not fret. I am expecting a visit to Styxia in the near future. Then, I will tell you all that I know.<br><br>Finally, allow me to conclude with an Aidonian blessing: <i>May the shadow of {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} shroud us so we may learn the splendor of light.</i><br><br><br><i>Aidonia</i><br><i>Amunet</i>"

                "Desc": "Democratic politics has always fascinated citizens of different city-states in Amphoreus. When Okhema was first established, its democracy was limited to a privileged minority. However, through ongoing reforms, the Okheman citizens' assembly took to the stage, transforming Okhema's governance into a \"democracy for all\" — where the citizens' assembly made every major decision.<br><br>It's important to note that as the black tide draws near and citizens from other city-states join Okhema's political life, the precious rights of Okhema's original citizens are becoming increasingly diluted... Consequently, voices calling for reforms with the Okheman citizens' assembly system grew ever louder.<br><br>Democracy is only one of the consequences of civilization's development, rather than the cause of development. For democracy to be productive, it must enact different rules for different societies, situations, and issues. No single rule can be optimal for all scenarios.<br><br>In other words, Okhema's citizens' assembly system will continue to evolve as this book is written. Due to time limitations, this publication focuses only on the current Okheman citizens' assembly, not its future developments. Readers should bear this limitation in mind.<br><br><b>Citizens, Citizenship, and Citizenship Policies of Okhema</b><br>Before examining the Okheman citizens' assembly's operational mechanisms and core functions in-depth, we must first address the matter of citizens, citizenship rights, and citizenship policies of Okhema. The elders have once noted that Okhema is a collective of free citizens. Due to the substantial power citizens possess, citizenship qualifications must be strictly regulated to ensure citizens' rights.<br><br>Discussions on the recognition of naturalized citizens' rights were once the foci of disputations between the leader of the Chrysos Heirs and the Council of Elders. As more Amphorean city-states fell over time and as the black tide drew closer, citizenship rights reforms became imperative... Judging from the final outcome, citizens from all city-states have equal citizenship rights in the holy city and can have equal participation in public matters.<br><br>While social differences naturally exist — between rich and poor, locals and travelers — the holy city of Okhema would not allow these social distinctions to become political divisions and will ensure complete political equality among all citizens.<br><br>(Continued)<br><br><b>Operational Mechanisms of the Citizens' Assembly</b><br>Barring emergencies, Okhema's citizens' assembly follows strict protocols when it is called. The current Council of Elders, a governmental entity made of representatives of the city-state, posts the upcoming citizens' assembly agenda and venue — usually Dawncloud in the holy city — at the Wall of Heroes before each meeting.<br><br>Usually, topics are proposed by Council of Elders members before the assembly and become official assembly items after receiving majority council approval. The Council pre-determines which matters to address and when. Once confirmed, the council chairman hands over the agenda to the Council of Elders's \"Assembly Chair,\" who presides over the meeting.<br><br>Normally, matters cannot be discussed at the citizens' assembly without prior council review. Council-reviewed matters yield only two outcomes: Either they're already thoroughly discussed and only need citizen votes, or they require citizens to hold debates to reach final resolutions during the assembly.<br><br>Results are tallied using pottery shards blessed with {RUBY_B#Worldbearing Titan}Kephale{RUBY_E#}'s runes, with voting dolia placed throughout Okhema during assemblies. After thorough discussion and voting of all proposals, the Council of Elders posts approved decrees at the Wall of Heroes.<br><br>(Continued)<br><br><b>Core Functions of the Citizens' Assembly</b><br>The assembly wields the important capacities of legislative power, the appointment of government officials, declaring war, conceding peace, and the actual control of armies during wartime.<br><br>Yet, historically and practically, Okhema's citizens' assembly isn't fully controlled and directed by \"citizens,\" but rather a means to ensure that \"elites\" who represent the majority social interests can effectively manage social matters.<br><br>In other words, the current system where the leader of the Chrysos Heirs and the Council of Elders jointly manage Okhema was decided by the Okheman citizens' assembly system. Citizens influence policymakers through voting and other means of political participation rather than directly managing social affairs or making political decisions.<br><br>(Continued)<br><br><b>Appendix: Principal Members of the Council of Elders</b><br>The Council of Elders is a governmental organization consisting of representatives from Amphoreus's city-states. While most are elected by their city-states, some receive direct invitations from current Council of Elders members. Authorized by the citizens' assembly, they manage various practical affairs within Okhema.<br><br>The most renowned honorary Elder is Lycurgus, an Antikytheran — a race that was already nearly extinct before the Chrysos War. He had communicated directly with {RUBY_B#Worldbearing Titan}Kephale{RUBY_E#} multiple times during the Era Chrysea and passed the wishes of mortals to Kephale, showing himself as a true \"Theoros.\" Lycurgus's neutrality is well noted by all, which explains his frequent selection as the citizens' assembly chair.<br><br>Significantly, Elder Caenis has shown great effectiveness in Okhema's governance and gathered many followers. Many believe Caenis will leverage accumulated resources to challenge the current situation where the Chrysos Heirs hold real authority and transform Okhema's political structure."

Led by their chief, they built dams and dug channels to block the waves. This caught Phagousa the Titan's playful attention, who destroyed their work with giant waves. When the chief angrily questioned this, the Titan transformed into a great whale and proposed a wager: If they could cross the sea to a distant island within seven days, the Titan would cease troubling them and grant them their treasure. But should they fail, their coast would forever remain submerged.<br><br>In common versions, humans triumph because Aquila taught their chief to build rafts in dreams, with help from Georios on their journey. But in versions told in some coastal cities (like Aristia), Phagousa is the only Titan who appears: They teach shipbuilding to the chief as they are intrigued by a challenge from humanity and try to ensure fair play. Finally, they gave up being an obstacle for humanity due to being moved by human courage.<br><br>Compared to popular versions, this portrayal of Phagousa shows more complexity and vitality. The divine-human connection strengthens, with more similarities in their personalities and behaviors. Given the various coastal city-states' reverence for Phagousa, I boldly hypothesize that, under the influence of different regional cultures, people unconsciously \"project\" their needs and desires, or the needs and desires of their group, onto Titans.<br><br>I will now prove this point from a different perspective. It's well known that, among Zagreus's pranks done on the gods, the most famous is stealing Mnestia's offerings by hiding in the shadow of Mnestia's statue. In popular versions, there is a seemingly unimportant detail at the end of the story: Unable to catch Zagreus, Mnestia punishes their own priest instead, cursing him to never see beauty again.<br><br>Such a small detail sparked major debates many times among scholars and artists in the history of city-states like Aurelia and Milios — due to their different backgrounds, positions, and beliefs, people have different levels of acceptance toward this \"whimsical divine punishment.\" Some extreme Mnestia disciples reject it persistently entirely, violently declaring it \"shameful blasphemy against the perfect divine\" and consider the topic an unmentionable taboo on all ceremonial occasions.<br><br>The above is the foundation of the content that this book will now discuss in detail, which is the variations in Titan worship rituals in different regions — In other words, how people from different cultural environments conduct appropriate ceremonies to please the corresponding Titans based on their understanding of divine preferences and tendencies.<br><br>(...)"

In truth, the entire process of seeking prophecies has devolved into an intricate intelligence network:<br><br>1. Information Gathering<br>They established three levels of request offices, each staffed with dedicated priests who record clients' information and monitor lower-level priests' performance. Priests must document detailed backgrounds, relationships, and social status of all inquirers. Additionally, they maintain files on clients, regularly reporting to the highest-ranking priests.<br><br>2. Priority Classification<br>When disciples come to seek prophecies, they are pre-sorted into three levels based on their questions and status. Priests schedule consultations according to priority — even if disciples have already offered tributes of equal value, unless... they pay more.<br>Highest Priority: Matters concerning city-state affairs.<br>Second Priority: Major life decisions affecting daily life.<br>Lowest Priority: Common folk's requests, usually rejected for \"insufficient devotion\" or delayed by \"priest under training.\"<br><br>Desecration of Ritual<br>Most appalling is their profanation of sacred ceremonies.

Had I not ground the incense myself, I'd never have discovered its contents.<br>...Prayer chambers feature unique acoustic designs, making priests' words create an illusion of \"prophecy\" when they talk. Not to mention window and lighting designs are made to cause specific visual confusion — even if disciples feel dizzy from the dome's focused light, they'd attribute it to \"divine might.\"<br><br>3.

All stories contained are true stories that occurred during the time of great change in the Grove and are preserved by the sacred tree of Cerces. May the light of intellect and reason shine on forevermore</i><br><br>The School of Eternity<br>For countless mornings we would recite the teachings of Thalesus on the stone steps of the Courtyard of Storge. As the morning dew condensed on the leaves above us, it would drip onto the pages of our books. I always believed back then that these water droplets must contain the sparks of wisdom, just as Cerces condenses every new thought into nourishing dew.<br>Thinking back now, perhaps that dew really did contain some form of divinity. How else could we have enjoyed such wonderful moments inside the Grove for so long? How else would even the dullest of students have been able to gradually achieve enlightenment within it?<br><br>The Final Lecture<br>The lesson that day was meant to be like any other. We were discussing the differences between the ideals of Erythrokeramism and Helkolithism at the Star-Chase Atrium, to debate whether sensory knowledge supersedes reason or whether reason births sensory knowledge.<br>Suddenly, someone shouted out: \"Look! Up in the sky! What is that!?\"<br>We raised our heads to see that the stars in the sky had dimmed as if they were eclipsed by a layer of fog. Only later did we learn that this was the portent of the black tide's coming.<br>The teacher calmly responded: \"...Everyone, we shall terminate our teachings for this semester here. I hope that you will all remember that thought is the most noble form of ritual.\"<br>That was the final lesson that I received within the Grove.<br><br>Tears and Grief<br><i>The following words were discovered on the wall of the Chamber of Purifying Tears</i><br>Dearest mother:<br>I remember that you once told me that the cold can clear our minds. Now, immersed in the cold of this pool, all I feel is numb.<br>I never got to see you on the day that you left us. You followed the caravans to Okhema and said you would bring me back a copy of <i>On the Seven Emotions and Three Forms of Love</i>. But the black tide came too quickly.<br>Now, I finally understand why this place is called \"the Chamber of Purifying Tears.\" This pool is not only purifying my body, it is also washing away the sadness in my heart.<br>Oh, how I wish I could taste your cinnamon rolls just one more time.<br>Your daughter, Elina.<br><br>Dying Ramblings<br><i>Recorded from a dying White Dryad</i><br>...They said that we would die, but how could a tree fear death? Our root systems are connected and our memories flow between us. Even if our branches dry and rot, the seeds of intellect will sprout again.<br>I remember the scholars who would come and go through this land. They would speak to us and see us as beings of wisdom. It was fascinating. They forget the wisdom of life itself in their pursuit of eternal knowledge.<br>When the black tide breaks us down, it is the youngest branches that wither first. This reminds me of the first lesson of Cerces: Reason must be rooted in the earth...<br><br>Confessions of a Fugitive<br>As I escaped with all of the books I could carry, the Library of Philia had already been mostly overrun by the black tide. Those precious manuscripts dissipated into a cloud of black smoke in an instant.<br>I came across many other scholars who were trying to escape along my way. We supported each other and shared what rations we had remaining. When we were overwhelmed with fear, we would take turns reciting the content of the works we could remember, so we wouldn't lose the wisdom of the Grove.<br>As we were running away from the Grove, it was with uttermost irony that we kept remembering the warning Thalesus shared in <i>Regarding Pilgrimages</i>: \"When you are chasing after the stars, make sure to pay attention to what lies underfoot.\"<br>Perhaps this is some kind of cruel joke of fate. Though we have come to this place to pursue knowledge, it is only when we are running for our lives that we finally come to understand the teachings of the sages that came before us.<br><br>Final Prayer<br><i>A slate discovered next to a corpse</i><br>Oh, great Cerces! You have taught us reason and intellect, but never the terror of death.<br>As the black tide devoured your roots, I saw the final leaf on your branches still trying to stretch out and reach towards the skies.<br>If this is truly the end, please grant me your tenacity and allow me to think until my final moment.<br><br><i>Editor's Afterword:</i><br><i>As I was compiling these stories, I often found myself unable to stop crying. As each tear fell onto the paper below, it would cause the ink to spread into a small pool. It was as if those who had passed were still trying to tell me their unfinished stories.</i><br><i>However, I think that this is the final epiphany that Cerces has left us: That even in the darkest of times, the Coreflame of Reason will never be extinguished. If you are reading this in the distant future, please remember: The Grove was not merely a place that imparted knowledge to countless scholars, it is also a symbol of our ideals and beliefs. Though we have fallen, our ideals and faith will always remain here, never to be extinguished.</i>"

I have noticed a lot of new faces among the Holy Maiden's guards recently. Though they have not started to limit my actions yet, they are flies on the wall that I am certain are reporting back constant surveillance to Dannalio and his followers. The majority of the priests and officials who I got along with have been removed from the temple and posted as envoys to other cities, and my contact with civilians is under strict control. Dannalio's party is clearly doing everything they can to weaken my influence.<br><br>       Though I bear the lofty titles of High Priest and Oracle Maiden, I have no right to speak on most matters and am left with empty titles alone. If there are any officials or higher-ups in this great city of Janusopolis — the so-called origin of the tripartite prophecy and the holy city upon which the Fate Titans lay their gaze — who still hold devotion to the gods... I fear it is just the two of us.<br><br>       ...<br><br>      One more thing. In this time of war among the Titans, where Nikador has trampled Georios into the ground and hounded Aquila across the land, many people whose cities have been destroyed have travelled far to request a prophecy from us. I have looked into visitors we have had from the outlands over the past century and discovered that we have not received any envoys from the most distant city-states for some time. These cities would have been along the warpath of the savage god. I sought prophecy from the Titans and the response I received was... That these distant small states were annihilated long ago.<br><br>       The Fate Titans revealed the name of the culprit long ago... The black tide. The destruction of these city-states was different to those destroyed by Thanatos or Nikador. Though these two gods are brutal and merciless, there would always be survivors left to weep for the dead — the entire civilization would not simply be wiped out overnight. However, with the black tide... It was as if the city-state was torn directly out of the ground of Amphoreus. Almost no survivors remain, except for the heavenly-blessed state of dragons and waves. That's why we have so many voices in this world that resent Nikador and curse Thanatos, yet very few report the devastation of the black tide. This bias has caused the various city-states to overlook the threat that the black tide poses.<br><br>       What's more, I did some research on the warpath of Nikador, and there is one question that I cannot get off of my mind: In the past century, why is it that the Lance of Fury has seldom turned their destruction on city-states in the center of Amphoreus, and spent their time roaming those on the very outskirts? It is said that Okhema is under the protection of the omnipotent Kephale, but I have an absurd hypothesis... Nikador, the mad king and the savage god held in such disdain by the people of this world, is actually the guardian that protects us from the black tide. I fear this villain that destroys all city-states in their path is simply trying to drive people out of areas that are doomed to extinction, just like the story of the Mountainbreaker Geocles...<br><br>       ...<br><br>       There can be no doubt that it is just a matter of time until the black tide becomes the greatest threat to Amphoreus. However, looking at the chaos that Janusopolis has now descended into, I worry whether people will be able to regroup and face the threat of the black tide with the necessary tenacity once the Calamity Titans' threat pauses. The world needs the Holy Maiden of the Three Fates to guide its future. She must be the envoy that carries the true prophecy to rescue this world, not just a puppet used to placate the masses.<br><br>       ...<br><br>       Dannalio and the others are growing bolder in their actions by the day. I fear I do not know when they will make their move against me and Tribios. Of all the priests in the temple, you are the only one that I trust, Lord Acolyte. I am willing to entrust the authority to pass on the Holy Maiden's prophecy to you. In return, I would ask that you watch over Tribios should I ever become unable to care for her and create a hidden escape path inside our secret room in case of emergency.<br><br>        May Janus reveal the path ahead for you, for me...

                "Desc": "<i>Author: Successor of the School of Nodism, Apuleius</i><br><br>The School of Erythrokeramism has never published any monographs. This fact inevitably attracts criticism and means that the debate of \"whether Erythrokeramism should even exist\" has persisted since its conception. In light of this, I am writing this short article to analyze the rationality of the existence of the School of Erythrokeramism from the point of view of Nodism. This article will not contain any complex mathematical knowledge, so please read ahead without concern.<br><br>Let us first recall the original purpose of Erythrokeramism's founding. It is said that the sage who founded Erythrokeramism summarized this as being: \"The information that we receive directly through our senses is the most pure. It is these materials that have not undergone excessive processing that form the most peaceful world we see.\" In other words, Erythrokeramism is in direct disagreement with Nodism and refuses understanding based on reason and the analysis of relationships between all things. They only examine the portion of the \"world\" that they can witness with their senses.<br><br>It is for this reason that critics often believe that Erythrokeramism must have the least value and validity in the eyes of us Nodists. It is also for this reason that people encourage us to \"make a proposal to revoke the rights of this school which wastes the Grove's resources.\"<br><br>Unfortunately for these people, if we are talking solely in terms of academic value, the Nodist School does not agree with this perspective. To us, the Erythrokeramists happen to be an outstanding example: They strive to preserve human subconscious reactions to all things and use this to obtain a clearer recognition of the exact nature of our minds.<br><br>It is hard to expand on this without becoming overly abstract, so allow me to raise an example (or perhaps I should say tell a story). I once toured Okhema alongside Madam Socrippe of the Erythrokeramist School, and we had the following discussion:<br><br>Apuleius (Hereon shortened to \"A\"): Logical deduction is to all things, as the Worldbearing Titan raising the heavens is to humanity.<br><br>Socrippe (Hereon shortened to \"S\"): I agree, as they are no more than castles in the sky.<br><br>A: What do you mean by this?<br><br>S: Though the Worldbearing Titan has lifted the clouds, the black tide still rages beneath them. The method they used to rescue us was to raise us into the sky for our protection. A castle can be built in the sky — they just require a ladder to be of any use.<br><br>S: The same can be said for the views of you Nodists — you were fortunate enough to discover a number of eternal truths, so you cling to them. You believe that these truths will grant you spiritual safety in a world of constant change.<br><br>A: Truth is truth, whether people cling to it or not.<br><br>S: So truth to you is natural beauty.<br><br>A: I would not deny that claim.<br><br>S: Then, in my eyes, the Nodist School has done no more than imagine a new set of senses for themselves: Senses that see in greater detail than the eyes and hear more clearly than the ears.<br><br>S: ...But frankly, I still believe this to be no more than a castle in the sky built to protect yourselves.<br><br>A: What is it that we are protecting?<br><br>S: You are protecting your minds by abandoning the sensory functions that the Titans gifted you. Your aesthetics are realized through fantasy — there is no such thing as a perfectly straight line or round circle in this world, just as infinity or negative values do not truly exist.<br><br>A: It is precisely because these things do not exist in reality that we require them to comprehend reality.<br><br>S: Then you are doing nothing more than walking backwards on a sphere. You took the longest possible route to arrive at a destination that would have been right behind you if you'd looked.<br><br>A: You say that, but I do not believe that abandoning all thought will bring me peace.<br><br>S: I am not asking you to give up on all thoughts. I am just suggesting that you listen to what it is that your senses are telling you. You must first be able to accept the existence of contradictions. That is the prerequisite for being able to appreciate them.<br><br>S: ...Ah. Speaking in the manner of your school, just so you can understand me, is so exhausting.<br><br>A: Oh? Then how would you express the perspective you were proposing in your school's words?<br><br>S: If you were my student, I would have you sit here completely without thinking. You would use your eyes to listen to the sound of the wind and use your ears to savor the fragrance of incense.<br><br>A: I don't understand.<br><br>S: The world has never asked us to understand it. Your senses are capable of providing you with information that is far purer than any that your mind can distil. It's just that you have used thought to actively deny it.<br><br>A: I do not think that these things that you are referring to can be subject to intellectual analysis.<br><br>S: Oh, then congratulations! You have finally taken your first step towards understanding Erythrokeramism.<br><br>S: That's right. It is precisely because \"intellect\" is not all-powerful that we need to remain wary and not allow it to believe itself omnipotent.<br><br>S: People often say that intelligence makes one humble. However, I believe that this humble attitude is no more than another form of arrogance: It is precisely through this sort of illusion that we mistakenly believe that we can stand on the same platform as all supreme beings.<br><br>S: To explain in the words of my school, your obsession with the concept of \"self\" is too strong. You consider the Titan raising the heavens extremely beautiful, so you imagine a cloud and place yourself shoulder-to-shoulder with them upon it.<br><br>A: You cannot deny the beauty of the Worldbearing Titan. It is right there before your eyes. As for the clouds that we create, that is not imagination either. It is another form of reality.<br><br>S: You are quite right. But you can still obtain inner peace without these creations. That is the essential difference between our two schools.<br><br>Considering that there may be some of you that were not able to fully understand this dialogue and what Madam Socrippe and I were discussing, allow me to provide a simple (yet not entirely accurate) translation: The reason the Erythrokeramists reject analytical thought is that taking a practical approach to life shows us that analytical thought is not omnipotent. There are too many kinds of knowledge in this world (in the eyes of the Erythrokeramists, art, emotions, and desires are all alternative forms of knowledge) that cannot be summarized through analytical thought. It is not that the Erythrokeramists cannot carry out intellectual analysis (as you can see in this recorded conversation, Madam Socrippe's analytical skills are on par with my own), but they refuse to use intellectual analysis to measure the world around us. Or, perhaps I should say, they refuse to reduce thoughts down to basic original knowledge (which is the core concept behind the Nodist School).<br><br>This is also why I will refer to this article as: <i>Foundations of Erythrokeramism's Theory of Consciousness</i>. To express this in the Nodists' phraseology: In order to expose the existence of the subconscious, the Erythrokeramists must confront the conscious mind head-on.<br><br>If the Erythrokeramists were to exist no more, no one in the Grove would ever follow this practice again.<br><br>I hope that this view of mine has helped you all to understand the value of the existence of the Erythrokeramists (that is, if you truly cannot appreciate their works of art)."

As the school with the longest history in the Grove of Epiphany, scholars have access to priceless knowledge that has been handed down through the Nodist School over millennia. This knowledge is built on a basis of a very small and necessary number of foundational facts, and employs strict tautology to eliminate all<br>\"self-evident truths\" that may create misconceptions.<br><br>3. It is for this reason that although our school may revere the Titans in daily life and honor the morality of Amphoreus, when it comes to research, we refuse to discuss them without rigorous consideration. We discourage anyone who would use this as an excuse to indulge in excessive vapid discussion without engaging in the work of academia from joining.<br><br>4. Our school maintains the belief that, as a theoretical pillar, mathematics is a science that examines the relationships between all things in this world in an absolute and rigorous manner. We welcome all seniors, fellows, and students who also hold this opinion of mathematics.<br><br>5. This school does not set any form of standardized assessments. That being said, in order to ensure that no one's time is wasted, we hope that you will consider your ability to answer the following questions before contacting us:<br><br>1. Why is it that the conclusions reached by mathematics can be deemed worthy of the name \"truth\" when those of the other schools can only be referred to as \"knowledge\"?<br>2. Why is it that even the great and mighty Titans are forced to obey the laws of mathematics?<br>3. Why is it that we say that if the world were to have a foundational language, then it must be mathematics?<br>4. Why is it that people say the divine authority of the Titans can be changed as they please, but the conclusions of mathematics could not possibly ever change?<br>5. Why is it that it is not just numbers alone, but the concept of infinity (infinitely small, infinitely large, infinite distance) can also become objects of study for mathematicians?<br>6. Why is it that the seemingly objective study of mathematics is a creation of the subjective will in humanity and Titans, and also cannot ever be separated from it?<br>7. Why is it that (6) and (1) do not contradict each other?<br>8. Why can 1+1=2 be completely proven with just a single sentence?<br>9.

                "Desc": "<i>Grove of Epiphany historical document: Volume 3. Recorded by: Nousporist scholar Herodotan — Light Calendar Year 4919</i><br><br>Since the establishment of the Grove, scholars have maintained a level of restraint when it came to debates and disagreements. After centuries of maintaining this balance, a debate erupted that became a matter of our survival or extinction. The cause of this debate was the balance between reason and faith. A portion of the scholars believed that the Grove should act purely in pursuit of knowledge. Others argued that scholars must not deviate from their reverence of Cerces. The debate intensified by the day, as scholars from each school eventually split into seven independent groups, each operating independently in separate areas of the Grove.<br><br>The Lotophagists moved from the Courtyard of Storge to a remote forest, the Caprist scholars led their beasts into seclusion, and the Nodist mathematicians even claimed that they would leave the Grove to find a \"pure land that had not been tainted by idiocy.\" Seeing this paradise of intellect about to be divided, each school had no choice but to meet and discuss a countermeasure.<br><br>After three months of constant negotiation, the seven schools finally agreed to hold a conference in the Star-Chase Atrium. The conference continued for a full seven days. According to the records from the time, the first day of discussion almost spiraled out of control. The Venerationists persisted in their belief that all research should be completed with reverence for the Titans at its core. The Helkolithists on the other hand disputed this, saying that excessive reverence would impede the search for truth. The Erythrokeramists went on to criticize the other schools for \"stifling the freedom of artistic expression in the name of reason.\"<br><br>The dispute persisted until the fourth day, when a rare lightning storm hit the Grove by surprise and the scholars were forced to move to the Library of Philia to rest and seek refuge from the rain. It was during this tea break that the scholars began to reflect on one question: Why would Cerces choose to come to earth in the form of a tree?<br><br>The Caprists pointed out that trees need to be rooted to the ground as well as growing upwards towards the sky. They must follow the rules of growth whilst adjusting to the changes in their environment. The Nodist mathematicians added that the form of a tree itself contains a most strict mathematical structure. The Lotophagists on the other hand reminded everyone that the growth of a tree is dependent on sunlight, rainfall, and nutrients from the soil, much like knowledge requires various sustenance to grow.<br><br>By the sixth day, the various schools finally reached an accord regarding their management structure: The establishment of the Seven Sages system would allow each school to maintain their independence while simultaneously keeping each other in balance. However, debate regarding the candidate for Head Sage led to an unprecedented stalemate.<br><br>Each school insisted that their beliefs were closest to the ideals of Cerces: The Cryptogenists (currently known as the Nousporists, hereafter referred to as the \"Nousporists\" for clarity) placed importance on seeking out the true nature of life itself, the Lotophagists maintained the importance of cultivation of body and mind, the Caprists advocated returning to nature, the Nodists held watertight logic in the highest esteem, the Venerationists emphasized divine rituals, the Helkolithists sought perfect balance, and the Erythrokeramists stood in defense of artistic freedom.<br><br>This debate endured an entire day and night. People proposed all sorts of solutions: A rotation system, a parliamentary system, and someone even proposed a lottery system. However, there was no one solution that could satisfy everyone. Just when the stalemate reached its pinnacle, a single leaf fell from the sacred tree and happened to land in the center of the conference table. This sight reminded the scholars of an ancient proverb: Cerces once said that the roots of the tree of reason are just as important as its branches. If one end is neglected, the entire tree will wither.<br><br>After a long period of silence, someone proposed an idea: As no one can represent Reason itself, why do we not leave the seat of Head Sage permanently empty as tribute to Cerces? This proposal spread throughout the venue and gradually gained favor. Not only would this gesture show reverence to the Titans, it also serves as a reminder to all scholars: No one should try to overstep the authority of Reason themself.<br><br>By the seventh day, the various schools finally reached an accord regarding their management structure: They established the Seven Sages system to achieve balance in the Grove. The Seven Sages were not merely leaders. They were also a carefully constructed management system.<br><br>At this point, the Seven Sages each took charge of the seven major roles within the Grove:<br>1. The Nousporism Sage was responsible for reviewing experiments and research to ensure that investigations would not endanger the Grove itself.<br>2. The Lotophagism Sage managed medicines and meals to maintain the physical and mental health of the various scholars.<br>3. The Caprism Sage would oversee the forests and the beasts to balance the boundaries between nature and humankind.<br>4. The Nodism Sage took responsibility for books and documentation to ensure the preservation and passing on of knowledge.<br>5. The Venerationism Sage managed important ceremonies to maintain the connection between the Grove and the Titans.<br>6. The Helkolithism Sage supervised physical training to cultivate the practice of unifying the mind and body.<br>7. The Erythrokeramism Sage took charge of artistic education to nourish the growth of the soul and the senses.<br><br>Following this, they established a strict system of rules:<br>1. Each Sage can serve for only seven years, and their role cannot be held repeatedly by a scholar of the same school.<br>2. An important decision requires the agreement of at least five Sages.<br>3. If any experiment or research involves three or more different schools, it must undergo joint review by the relevant Sages.<br>4. Each Sage has the right to veto dangerous behaviors within their school.<br>5. If a Sage neglects their duties, the other six can unite to impeach them.<br><br>Finally, they established a succession system to ensure that the system can be passed down properly:<br>1. Each Sage must raise three candidates for their succession.<br>2. The successor must obtain the approval of at least four other Sages.<br>3. Successors of seats in other schools must learn from each other's areas of expertise.<br>4. The successors must live together for one year inside the Library of Philia to nurture a mutual understanding.<br><br><color=#dbc291ff>As for the seat of Head Sage, it will forever be reserved for the sacred tree and Reason themself.</color><br><br>At the end of the protocol agreement, the seven schools wrote a concluding remark: \"We pursue knowledge, but do not overstep divinity. We respect faith, but do not deviate from reason. Just as the roots of the sacred tree intertwine, intellect and reverence too must complement one another.\"<br><br>It is clear from the subsequent influence it has had that the Protocol of the Seven Sages not only ensured the free development of academic research but also maintained checks and balances between the various schools. Even more importantly, it sets an example for future generations: True intellect is derived from the fusion of diverse influences, not from a singular supremacy. It was the equilibrium ensured by this protocol that allowed the Grove of Epiphany to maintain its vitality in the years to come.<br><br><br><color=#dbc291ff>Attachment: List of Current Seven Sages in the Grove</color><br><br>Lotophagism: Medea<br>Caprism: ██████<br>Nodism: Apuleius<br>Venerationism: █████<br>Helkolithism: ████████<br>Erythrokeramism: Socrippe<br>Nousporism: Anaxa"

I don't want to go into the River of Souls bound in chains of shame and watch myself sink into the murky waters never to achieve release.<br><br>It's been fifty-three years.<br><br>I have spent the majority of my life in Janusopolis. I worked my way up from being an ignorant trainee priest to a high-ranking position in the priesthood. Now, I am just an old man hiding in a ruin. When I was young, I always thought that I was doing some kind of holy duty and devoting my life to serving the Titans. Looking back now, I realize that I was just another mortal driven by greed.<br><br>Or, perhaps, our actions are inherently blasphemous against the Titans. No, perhaps \"blasphemy\" is the wrong word... What we do is more complicated than that. I still remember... When a young Holy Maiden first entered the Hall of Prophecy, she really could sense some kind of power. I've seen it many times now: Their eyes glaze over, their bodies begin to shake gently, and their mouths begin to spout words that even they don't understand. This is a true prophecy — whispers that come from the other side of the Gate of Infinity. However, these kinds of prophecies are vague and hard to comprehend. They are full of contradictions. It is this lack of clarity that gave us room to interpret their meaning.<br><br>In the beginning, we were simply... Tweaking them slightly. Much in the way that a gardener would prune a bush, we would gently trim away any untimely parts of the prophecy and stress the warning signs that would be beneficial. Who could say that this was wrong? A chaotic prophecy would only cause panic after all, while a prophecy that has undergone some organization can guide people.<br><br>However, power is a strange thing. It can make you believe that you are doing the right thing until it's too late for you to change. Gradually, we were no longer satisfied with simply changing prophecies. We began to filter the Holy Maidens and search for those candidates that were more obedient and more willing to listen to our \"guidance and opinions.\" We would put medicines in their food and drink and say that they \"would aid in meditation.\" Finally, we even began pre-preparing prophecies ourselves for the Holy Maidens to read out during ceremonies.<br><br>...<br><br>I remember a young girl named █████. She was the most talented Holy Maiden I had ever seen. There were times when I began to suspect that one of the Titans was actually projecting through her... But her prophecies were always untimely: She would prophesy peace when we needed war and warn of disasters when we coveted stability. The other priests grew most displeased with her because of this. At that time, I thought that I was protecting her. I taught her how to give the \"correct\" prophecy. Thinking about it now, perhaps she was trying to save us — but we turned down this opportunity time and time again.<br><br>A prophecy should be the true words of the gods, but we changed them into our own personal instructions. In truth, what we did was even more subtle than that. The \"prophecies\" that we created were just like a mirror. They made it easy to see whatever it was you wished to see. When a priest is expecting a prophecy of war, any light breeze can be interpreted as the sound of a blade slipping from its sheath. Perhaps we were not counterfeiting prophecies, but merely choosing to hear what we wanted.<br><br>The most ironic thing is that even manipulated prophecies would sometimes reveal the truth. There was a ceremony in which ████ seemed to have lost her mind and started screaming in insanity: \"The abyss is opening its jaws! The holy city will be devoured in black water!\" In that moment, we thought it was just meaningless ramblings. Looking back now, perhaps the Titans had never left us. We just could no longer hear them.<br><br>I often wonder if Janus had been watching over this whole situation. Had the god behind the gate of destiny been mocking our arrogance this whole time? We thought that we were weaving fate. In fact, it was fate that was weaving the ridiculous lives of us mortals.<br><br>If you ask me, the future that I saw — the coming of the black tide — may not have been a punishment at all. Perhaps it was a release. It has washed away all of the lies that we carefully constructed to make us face the truth of this world.<br><br>...<br><br>I bumped into a number of familiar faces in the reflection room at the back of the temple. I still remember how they would dote on me back then... The beautiful jewels, the stacks of gold that would stretch out my silk purse... And all my favorite things from Okhema and Castrum Kremnos that they'd managed to get their hands on in one way or another and gone through hell to have delivered to my room. In what feels like the blink of an eye, these Holy Maidens are all old ladies now, but their eyes are clearer than ever. Strangely, when we spoke about the past, they didn't seem to hate me at all. \"Prophecies are naturally chaotic,\" they said, \"perhaps no one can ever understand the will of the Titans.\"<br><br>That's how it is. Though prophecies are chaotic, the food, clothing, and authority of the Holy Maidens were precisely controlled by mortals.<br><br>I can see my chances of survival slipping away. The terrifying black tide is growing ever closer. Though no one can see it, it is as clear as day in my pupils. I don't know why, but I feel a sense of calmness. Perhaps this is my final prophecy: After destruction, a new truth will be reborn."

My thoughts are beginning to grow blurred and blanks are appearing in my memory. However, these discoveries are far too important. They may have revealed the truth of what lies beyond the veil of Oronyx. I will attempt to use the last of my sanity to organize these notes.<br><br>Ceremony Preparation<br>As a Venerationist scholar, we are always studying various ceremonies that involve communication with the Titans. But, I wish to go one step further — I do not want to simply communicate with them. I want to observe them directly. Just how big is the Evernight Veil of Oronyx? What lies beyond it? Could that be the divine kingdom of the Titans? With the correct approach, I may be able to catch a glimpse of these secrets.<br><br>After many years of research, I have discovered a number of key elements:<br>1. The Orb — There is some kind of power contained in the Oronyx Orb.<br>2. A set astrological alignment.<br>3. An ancient incantation that must be chanted in the correct tone<br><br>First Attempt (Light Calendar Year 3749 — Month of Fortune)<br>The constellations are in perfect alignment tonight. After completing the purification ceremony in the Chamber of Purifying Tears, I began the first attempt.<br>I place the orb before my forehead and begin to chant. At first, nothing happened. However, I sensed something unusual after my seventh recital of the incantation. The veil seemed to pulse like a rippling water surface. What was even more unusual was that the starlight began to warp and form into patterns that I could not understand.<br><i>(There is an ink smudge here as if the writer spilled their ink in a hurry.)</i><br><br>...<br><br>Third attempt (time uncertain)<br>(It looks like the records for the second experiment are missing)<br>I think I have seen something. There is something flowing in the gaps of the veil. It doesn't look like starlight. Could it be aether? Something more fundamental... They seem to be... hmm... I can't find the words to describe it. Any time I try to describe them, the words just crumble on my tongue.<br>Interesting discovery: When I stare at the flowing matter, my thoughts seem to flow also. The boundary between the worlds of the present and the past grows blurred. I saw conversations that had not yet happened and heard the voices of people who had long passed.<br>Warning: Do not try to record these scenes in words. Every time I try, the text simply —<br><br>...<br><br>(Date unclear)<br>Something unexpected happened during today's experiment. When I activated three orbs at the same time, they broke and a huge explosion completely wiped out my laboratory. What does this mean? Is this a divine punishment of Oronyx? Did this happen because Oronyx is watching me and feels that my experiment has surpassed the rules laid upon mortals? Or could it be that the design of my ceremony was flawed and that caused the explosion?<br><br>My head is starting to hurt. My memory is becoming fragmented. I want to reorganize my manuscript. I remember I wrote down some numbers before... They were to do with the movement of the stars and other things... But there are only strange symbols on the manuscript now? They look like something I drew in my sleep. Just what on earth are they?<br><br>(Date unclear)<br>I have made a mistake. The veil is the divine realm of Oronyx. Mortals must not enter the divine realms of the Titans... What else was there? I don't remember. My head hurts.<br><br>Conclusion<br>To ███████, I don't think I can continue with this research.<br>Do not repeat my mistakes. There are some boundaries that must not be overstepped. I now understand why Oronyx created the Evernight Veil. It is the boundary that divides the sanity of mortals and the divine power of the Titans.<br><br>I have begun to doubt my existence. As I write these words, who is it that is moving my hand? When I reflect on such questions, who is it that is moving my thoughts? We believe that we are observing destiny, but perhaps we are the ones being observed... It is Oronyx that is observing us ridiculous mortals!<br><br><i>(The next few pages are littered with indecipherable symbols and chaotic lines.

                "Desc": "Preamble<br>In the years that offers verifiable historical records, the study of Titans has become a prominent science and has continued to flourish. However, it seems that exploration into Cerces has never gone deeper than the surface level. As a Nousporist scholar, I must say that this phenomenon is ironic — that our research into reason lacks any depth of reason at all.<br><br>In my many years of research, I have noticed a phenomenon that is worth serious consideration: As the manifestation of reason, what Cerces themself displays are not purely logical characteristics, but a subtle duality. This duality is not only reflected in their choice of form, but also in the way that they influence the world.<br><br>The Riddle of Form<br>First, let us consider a question: Why would the embodiment of reason choose to descend to the world in the form of the giant tree? This choice in itself harbors a deeper meaning. There are many records of scholars' thoughts regarding this question in the ancient writings of the Grove of Epiphany. Some believe that this is a rejection of geometry, and some believe that this hints that logic must be rooted in reality.<br>According to records saved in the Library of Philia, Cerces first took root in the world right at the beginning of the Era Creatura. The world at that time was full of chaos and instability, yet Cerces chose to tightly intertwine themself with the earth through their roots. This choice insinuates that logic is not in fact above nature, it actually needs to grow in the soil of reality.<br><br>The Dual Authority of Reason<br>In my research, I have discovered that the authority of Cerces actually consists of two seemingly contradictory aspects: Rational thought and procreation of life. This kind of duality has never been seen before in another Titan. When we observe the White Dryads of the Grove of Epiphany, this duality is particularly clear to see: They are not only capable of carrying out philosophical speculation but also maintaining the most primordial life force.<br>In my recent research on the rings of the Sacred Tree, I discovered that the growth of its rings displays surprising order and regularity. This order bears a striking resemblance to the golden ratio summarized by ancient mathematicians. This seems to show that the foundation of reason comes from the observation of the laws of nature.<br><br>Unity of Knowledge and Life<br>In the history of the Grove of Epiphany, we can see how Cerces perfectly unifies these two seemingly contrasting qualities. They are both the guardian of knowledge and the nurturer of life. Whenever the sparks of inspiration burst forth in the Grove, the giant tree will condense dew to sustain new ideas. These ideas will be converted into nourishment to promote the growth of life.<br>One particularly noteworthy idea is the Chamber of Purifying Tears's design. The traditional view is that cold aids in activating the brain and promoting thought. However, I have discovered through research that cold is a form of purification that allows those who seek knowledge to return to life's most basic and authentic state. This kind of ritualistic design perfectly embodies Cerces's dual attributes of reason and life.<br><br>Revelation<br>This discovery holds a special meaning in our current generation. When the black tide raged, and we were forced to leave our homes, pure rational planning alone would likely lead us to despair. It is just as I witnessed during my evacuation: Those who rely on reason alone will never get far, while those who listen to both the rational mind and the call of nature will often find a way to escape danger.<br>I will use the research of us Nousporists as an example: If we rely simply on cold alchemical calculations when seeking transformation from mortal to higher beings, we are doomed to failure. True transformation requires us to understand the duality of reason: It is the guidance to thought and the rhythm of life.<br><br>Conclusion<br>Through the research into the duality of Cerces, I have come to an important conclusion: Reason is not as singular as we commonly believe. It is both a method of thought as well as the rhythm of nature — the origin of knowledge and the impetus of growth. It is precisely this duality that has allowed Cerces to play such a unique role within the order of Amphoreus.<br>As I write this manuscript, I cannot help but recall the White Dryads I saw in the Grove of Epiphany. As they unfurled their branches and leaves under the rays of light, they not only abode by the most rational rules of growth, but they also displayed the most natural form of vitality. Perhaps this is the most direct hint that Cerces has left for us: That true reason must coexist symbiotically with life itself.<br><br><i>(Note: Part of the argument in this manuscript is derived from the research conducted on the age rings of the Grove of Epiphany's Sacred Tree. My sincere gratitude to my Nousporist colleagues for their support and suggestions.)</i>"

Instead, do some basic stretches to stimulate blood flow. After getting out of bed, wash your face with cold water, say your prayers, practice thought training, and have your first meal (only eat until about 70% full). Contrary to popular belief, the time between waking and eating is the best time for abstract thought. Intense exercise is not recommended.<br><br>2. Lucid Hour<br>The time of the day in which people are most talkative and quick-minded in disputation. As a scholar, one should actively take part in academic activities and research discussions (make sure not to be seated for too long; it is better to freely switch between sitting and standing). Team sports such as beast ball, smash ball, and stickball can also be organized during this time as a change of pace (as well as entertainment).<br><br>3. Action Hour<br>Action Hour is the time of day when everyone's brains begin to slow down and the time comes to charge your energy and engage in physical activity. After eating your second meal and resting for twenty to thirty minutes, you can begin jogging (please make ample preparations before exercising!) Those with extenuating circumstances can swim instead of jogging. This can reduce the damage to joints caused by exercise. (<b>Note: Do not disregard jogging entirely for this reason. Jogging is the best form of exercise, second only to swimming. Joint damage is never an excuse not to jog.</b>)<br><br>There is no set requirement for the distance that you jog or swim. Generally, when you feel that you cannot continue any longer and must rest, then rest for five minutes before continuing. (<b>Note: Do not take excessive rests</b>). We recommend keeping your total exercise duration within one hour. If you happen to have a form of manual work that can replace this form of exercise (such as transporting packages etc.), then taking part in this kind of manual labor is also a good option.<br><br>If you have no plans during Action Hour, such as conducting experiments, attending special training, joining social events, or personal recreation, you can begin a muscle strength training regimen straight after the aforementioned cardiovascular exercise program is complete. Strength training is best completed 2–4 times a week to maintain the explosive power of your muscles and prevent deterioration. Furthermore, participating in the various team activities mentioned above is also a good option.<br><br>4. Parting Hour<br>Having completed the harsh training of Action Hour, now is the best time to enjoy your third meal of the day. Make sure you don't push your final meal of the day back to Curtain-Fall Hour every day! Eating too late in the day will place a heavy burden on your body and halve the effectiveness of all your exercise.<br><br>After finishing your third meal, if you have already completed a considerable amount of exercise during Action Hour, you can use this time to engage in personal recreation activities. If not, this time should be used to supplement necessary daily exercise (such as those for cardiovascular function).<br><br>Gaining muscle is about persistence — no one is capable of perfectly planning their time without interference from external factors, and everyone feels lethargic from time to time — the key is learning to coexist with these inevitable factors. Therefore, do not feel like just giving up because you were not able to exercise during a set time, and do not push all of your projects back to the end of the day and deal with them then. I can tell you from experience that exercising with others is the easiest way to nurture good habits. What's more, this also makes it easier for you to participate in group activities that are more interesting than solo ones.<br><br>In short... Be sure to make lots of friends while you are exercising!<br><br>5. Curtain-Fall Hour<br>This is the time for sleep. You should not engage in any activities other than sleep during this time. Remember: Staying up late will greatly decrease the effectiveness of all the exercise you do and make the next day that much harder, adding all kinds of unnecessary risks and strain.<br><br>If you are unable to avoid staying up late, then it is best to sleep in and not force yourself to get up early."

Two days ago, I found out about how they wished to blaspheme Nikador with your life. But by then, you were already imprisoned, and even my frantic attempt to escape with you was too late. If I fail to convince your father — my husband, Eurypon — tomorrow, I'll launch a challenge to the crown, using gladiatorial combat to save you from his grasp. I'm not fully confident of my chances... but as your mother, I'm prepared to risk everything and sacrifice my own life, even dragging Eurypon with me into the depths of the River of Souls, if need be. When the throne stands vacant and chaos reigns in Kremnos, you can trust the protection of Krateros. He's my chosen guardian. You must treat him as an elder, and he will respect you as a king.<br><br>Mydeimos! Do not forget your father, Eurypon, even if you forget me, never forget that despicable king. We once vowed to terminate the tradition of patricide to usurp authority that sullies Kremnos in our era. Yet, along the journey, his greed and evil overwhelmed him, causing him to sacrifice even the honor of Nikador and tarnish Kremnos. Mydeimos! Do not follow in your father's footsteps!<br><br>Mydeimos, I still remember how your cry was so fragile and ethereal. Eurypon and I could never have imagined that such a feeble cry would come from our child. But when Nikador's battle cry resonated through the Soul-Forging Gate, echoing, the sound of your cry suddenly became crystal-clear resonant as the roar of the Tretos lion. There was no denying it: you are of pure Kremnoan blood, the son of {RUBY_B#Founder of Kremnos}Gorgo{RUBY_E#} born to take the crown!<br><br>But Mydeimos... I'm afraid your journey ahead is, starting tomorrow, fraught with hardships. I never thought I would be able to survive beneath the blade of the king of Kremnos, nor will I ever accept sitting by while Eurypon plans to take your life. Should that happen... you'd be orphaned, perhaps banished from Kremnos, forced to wander alone, forever branded with scars and blood.<br><br>Mydeimos... If this must come to pass... Then, as your mother, I wish you won't have to be the son of {RUBY_B#Founder of Kremnos}Gorgo{RUBY_E#}. You are simply the son of {RUBY_B#Queen of Kremnos}Gorgo{RUBY_E#}, the ordinary child of a Kremnoan mother. If you develop yourself with determination and eventually claim the title of champion or warrior, then I will be pleased even in the afterlife. However, if you have doubts about this so-called glory, then live as you please! Gorgo, the founder of Kremnos, per their will and their yearning, summoned Nikador and earned the glory of Strife. And you, my child, can also return home with true glory under the radiance of the Lance of Fury...<br><br>My dear Mydeimos...<br><br>Mydeimos...<br><br>Gorgo"

The specific year of this speech is unknown, and it may have been embellished or interpreted by later generations of priests. The theological interpretations of Robita's school of thought received mixed receptions from later generations and readers are reminded to approach their comments with a critical mind — Editor's note</i><br><br>(Preceding text has been lost)<br><br>People often say that if Oronyx is just willing to offer their assistance, we priests of Oronyx are able to see any moment in time as we please... Many of my own seniors and new students even hold this opinion. However, this is unfortunately an incorrect view born of people's misunderstandings of the Titans.<br><br>Although the Titans are indeed supreme beings, they are not omnipotent. The miracle of Oronyx is not to be able to directly \"see\" the past or future, but it is to be able to \"extrapolate\" them. Do not underestimate the importance of this distinction. In my opinion, if Oronyx was truly willing to help us predict the weather each day (or should I say, the tempers of Aquila)... Then there is a very real possibility that they could be mistaken.<br><br>I know that people say that the prophecy of Janus can create endless paths and choices for humanity. Then, does it not follow that this would also be the same for Oronyx? This statement is actually half correct... Though the divinities of Oronyx and Janus bear some similarities, neither of them has any relation to \"directly interacting with the past.\"<br><br>What Oronyx and Janus show their priests and allow them to interact with is not, in fact, reality itself. It is something that bears a great resemblance to reality. Perhaps this point is easier to explain in relation to Janus: Since we are able to select a specific \"history\" of something, that also means history cannot be real and fixed in the Titan's eyes... It becomes a reason for something to \"appear or disappear from existence.\" This is clearly different to the idea of \"history is the only true past\" that we have come to understand. The priests of Janus do not actually change the past, but they select a background or a \"state in which something exists.\" In other words, what the Titans help us to change is reality, not what has already happened in the past... Everything we see is no more than the process of rationalizing a \"changed reality.\" It seems to us like reversing the flow of time, but that is logically untrue.<br><br>If you can understand this, then it is much easier to understand the revelations (or dreams) of Oronyx: The reason that they refuse to tell us what the weather will be like the next day (though they could easily ask Aquila and find out) and the reason that they refuse to predict the lifespan and cause of death for the majority of the population is precisely because their divine powers are limited by being isomorphic with that of Janus. There is no way for them to predict exceedingly uncertain matters. <b>In other words, what Oronyx chooses to show us are prophecies that they are certain must have happened.</b> (Or \"absolutely will occur\" — tense has absolutely no meaning to Oronyx.) This makes the situation extremely easy to understand: What prophet would be willing to pronounce a prophecy that they themselves have no faith in?<br><br>So, if you have faith in my professionalism as a priest of Oronyx, I hope that you will realize one thing: Priests of Oronyx have already guided their divine power to the maximum potential. This maximum potential, if I were to describe it in blasphemous terms, is equivalent to placing Oronyx under house arrest. We give them no other work at all. We simply allow them to focus on searching for knowledge regarding the past and future... These are all the results that can be gained. If Oronyx is not willing (in my opinion it means that they have no confidence) then they will not (in actuality, they are unable to) share any revelations regarding information on the past, present, or future.<br><br>What you must all understand is that even the enormous power of the Titans has its limits.<br><br>(Following text has been lost)"

And if the black tide ever separates us, as long as you occasionally remember that I am here, I will still be content...<br><br><i>Yours sincerely, Nympha</i><br><br><br>(...)<br><br>My dear Aelius, Please forgive my failure to meet you today.<br><br>Recently, I have been frequenting the market, and although I have been cautious in my actions, it has still caught the attention of my parents. To avoid any unnecessary complications, I had no choice but to agree to attend today's civic court session with them.<br><br>My family has always been indifferent to the plight of the outlanders, and for a long time, I have refrained from involving myself in their decisions, for I disagree with their views. However... it is only today that I truly understand how extreme and narrow-minded they are, and my parents have not changed at all in the past twenty years.<br><br>Why must people hate each other because of their bloodlines? Why must we fight among ourselves? In these apocalyptic times, should the last city, Okhema, not be a refuge for all?<br><br>But my dear, no matter what, we will never be puppets of the grievances of the past generations. Our love is the will of Mnestia, and those who truly love will always be favored by the Titans.<br><br><i>Yours sincerely, Nympha</i><br><br><br><br>(...)<br><br>My dear Nympha, Regarding your previous suggestion, I have thought long and hard, and I have decided that I should speak with you face to face once more.<br><br>Castrum Kremnos and Okhema have long been at odds, so although I know I will face cold stares and obstacles, I have never once held any ill will towards your parents.<br><br>In my humble opinion, rather than taking you away from Okhema — the last sanctuary of humankind — to venture into the unknown, where monsters roam the land, I would prefer to fight within the city, to build an achievement worthy of your name.<br><br>Please believe me that this is not out of fear — at least not fear for my own safety — but from a concern that I may not be able to protect you amidst the black tide and the monsters that lurk.<br><br>I carry the bloodline of Kremnos in my veins, and once dreamed of returning to my homeland, believing in the ideal, \"valorous death before glorious return.\" Yet, it is only after meeting you that I have come to understand that love is far greater than the death of honor.<br><br>Your courage and determination are truly admirable, but please, my dear, forgive me — forgive this fool and coward, whose heart is filled with love, for not being able to bear any danger or harm that may lie close to you.<br><br>So please, grant me some more patience and trust. My beloved Nympha! Allow me to grow, so that I may be worthy of you — if we are indeed lovers destined by fate, Mnestia will surely watch over us!<br><br><i>Yours sincerely, Aelius</i>"

Fortunately, there were no serious injuries. Looking at the buildings in the surrounding area, we were able to make an initial inference that this world contained civilized life. While exploring the temple, we made first contact with the people of Amphoreus. They called themselves the Chrysos Heirs and were in the area to rescue refugees headed to the \"holy city\" of Okhema. The two Amphoreans were quite remarkable. The Chrysos Heir named Tribbie was able to use a mysterious power of space-time replication to repair buildings. The Chrysos Heir Phainon boasted remarkable martial arts prowess, breaking my lance with a single strike.<br><br>We rushed to the holy city with the refugees, but the Strife Titan \"Nikador\" happened to launch a surprise attack upon our arrival. The Titans are the Gods worshiped by the Amphoreans. It is currently unknown as to whether they have any relation to the Aeons. The Titankin of Nikador are extremely ferocious. With the situation looking dire, we offered our assistance to Phainon. We defeated every Titankin that stood in our paths, protected the citizens, and finally faced the body of Nikador alongside Phainon. Throughout this process, we came to meet Chrysos Heirs known as Mydei and Castorice. Mydei's martial arts skill was similar to that of Phainon, and Castorice was able to take the life of others through a simple touch.<br><br>It seemed that the Nikador who took part in this attack was just one of the many manifestations of the Strife Titan. Phainon was unable to obtain the crucial Coreflame that they spoke of. The leader of the Chrysos Heirs, Aglaea, took us to Marmoreal Palace and had the bath sprite tell us the history of Amphoreus. We learned that the Twelve Titans created Amphoreus, but that this world was now under threat of extermination. The Titans have lost their minds, and the Chrysos Heirs must defeat them one-by-one to light the Coreflames and save Amphoreus.<br><br>Aglaea also wields a remarkable ability... Her golden thread had the ability to read people's minds. She made a strange request for us: To not expose our identity as visitors from beyond the sky to the people of Okhema. The \"holy city\" of Okhema is the only place of eternal daytime in this world of apocalyptic night. We explored the city and came to learn of the local customs, as well as collecting reliable information. However, March 7th's picture was unexpectedly leaked. Not only did this lead to her being heralded as the \"Rosy Celestial Maiden\" by the Okheman citizenry, it almost led to fatalities. However, we were able to rescue this citizen who was hell-bent on exploring the skies at the cost of exposing our identities as guests from beyond the sky. Unfortunately, this meant betraying our promise to Aglaea.<br><br>...<br><br>In the end, our luck ran out. The golden thread of Aglaea spreads across all of Okhema and news of these decisions eventually reaches her ears. The leader of the Chrysos Heirs finally exposed her ruthless and unfeeling side, threatening our lives and asking us again why we had come to Amphoreus. Though we passed her examination, our impression of Amphoreus had dropped considerably, and we even considered leaving for a new destination. However, as we followed Phainon and learned of the Chrysos Heirs' brutal journey to save their world, we finally decided to remain in Amphoreus.<br><br>After some recovery, the Chrysos Heirs reconvened once more. They prepared to begin a crusade against Castrum Kremnos, the city in which Nikador was located, and steal the Coreflame of the \"Lance of Fury.\" {NICKNAME}, Phainon, and Mydei all came to Castrum Kremnos. The once war-obsessed city that used to be filled with the sounds of blades and battle had now become a gloomy wasteland. Now, the insane Nikador loomed somewhere in the depths of this moving fortress.<br><br>While exploring Castrum Kremnos, {NICKNAME} and the others learned that Nikador had long since hatched a plan for a terrible attack on Okhema. They successfully fought their way to Nikador. However, they unexpectedly discovered that the Titan that was once known for their glory had, at some point, forged themself an immortal body and was trying to wield the \"Blade of Fury\" to pierce Okhema from afar. In this moment of crisis, Mydei managed to restrain Nikador alone as the others returned to Okhema to discuss a way to foil Nikador's plans.<br><br>Castorice discovered that Nikador's immortal body came from their betrayal of \"death.\" In order to break this riddle that had been long buried in time, we headed to the Temple of the Three Fates located in the Abyss and attempted to use the power of Oronyx to replicate the past. However, Oronyx did not seem to welcome us. In fact, they attempted to stop us from reaching the temple depths using various puzzles and challenges. Their final puzzle was: To find something heavier than the \"World's Destiny.\" We were able to pass this test with the help of March 7th's camera and a little trickery.<br><br>However, although we made it to Oronyx's location, the Time Titan still refused to provide their assistance. Considering that time was running out to rescue Mydei, Phainon considered just killing the Titan and taking the Coreflame by force. Just as tensions were reaching a peak, Oronyx's attitude seemed to change when they laid eyes on {NICKNAME}. According to {NICKNAME}, Oronyx showed {F#her}{M#him} a memory of the Stellaron Hunters... It was a memory that logically should not exist, yet it was extremely vivid. Inside this nonexistent memory, {NICKNAME} happened to catch the gaze of the Aeon of Remembrance, Fuli. Perhaps it was a gift from Oronyx, but at that moment, a mysterious creature named Mem appeared at {F#her}{M#his} side. Though {F#she}{M#he} suddenly seemed to grow... somber, {F#she}{M#he} fortunately snapped out of it quickly.<br><br>Having returned from the Abyss, we split up once again. Phainon and I went on to assist Mydei in his perilous battle. {NICKNAME}, on the other hand, used the power gifted to them by Oronyx to collect memory fragments and find a way to visit the Castrum Kremnos of the past. With Castorice by their side, they would find a way to undo Nikador's immortality. At the same time, Aglaea was getting to work in Okhema dealing with Nikador's infiltration.<br><br>Having collected the memory fragments and successfully opened the gate to Castrum Kremnos' past, {NICKNAME} arrived in the ancient city. When they arrived, they discovered that the Kremnos Festival was in full swing and Nikador's descent into madness was just beginning. The city was yet still lively and bustling. In order to ensure the success of their plan, Castorice and {NICKNAME} decided to blend in with the festival and ended up forming a three-man team with a taciturn gladiator named Gnaeus before heading deep into the city. Collecting intel as they advanced, they vowed to restore Nikador's fractured mind, stop the birth of their immortal body, and restore the honor of the Strife Titan. What no one expected was that Gnaeus was actually a part of Nikador. Having learned of the suffering that awaits in the future, he fearlessly allowed himself to be integrated into Nikador's corrupted soul and made them whole again. Though we were able to undo their immortality, this also meant that the Titan stood before us in their ultimate form.<br><br>After a grueling battle, the \"Lance of Fury\" Nikador came to an end with the Chrysos Heirs' victory. After returning to Okhema and taking some time to recover, we witnessed the return of the Coreflame of Nikador. Phainon bid us a brief farewell before entering the Vortex of Genesis to undergo the trial of the Strife Titan's Coreflame. Through this trial, Phainon would obtain the powers of a demigod, while taking on the role of the corresponding Titan. I wish him success in this endeavor.<br><br>..."

                "Desc": "...<br><br>It's been a long while since Phainon entered the Vortex of Genesis for the Strife trial, leaving all Chrysos Heirs deeply concerned. When crisis struck during Phainon's Coreflame trial as we waited anxiously, we made the snap decision to join Castorice and Mydei in rescuing Phainon from possible peril.<br><br>{NICKNAME} and I became separated in this illusion. {NICKNAME} told me that {F#she}{M#he} travelled with Mydei and had seen the man's deepest fear, which was the blood-soaked glory of the Kremnos. As for me... I saw some visages of past lives too. Who would have thought that the trial of Strife would be a battle against your inner demons? It seems that {RUBY_B#Strife Titan}Nikador{RUBY_E#} is not the mad and tactless god told in legends.<br><br>We finally met up in the illusion of the trial after some fighting and found Phainon by following the sound of battle to the source of Strife. The man had almost lost control of himself due to the demons in his heart, and we saved him and extracted him from the trial. The failure of Phainon's Coreflame trial means the responsibility of bearing Nikador's divinity now falls to the lone crown prince of Kremnos — Mydei the Chrysos Heir. Yet, even as the orthodox heir to \"Strife,\" Mydei seems to have an absurd extent of hesitation and objection to accepting the god's authority.<br><br>After ensuring Phainon's safety, {NICKNAME} and I retreated to the bath chamber to rest. We also drew our own conclusions about the present situation in the world of Amphoreus: The development of this world is entirely too bizarre. Neither the Titans nor the black tide seem like characteristics that should be present in a culture that developed organically. However, various signs point to the Stellaron not being the mastermind behind it all. The puzzles in this world require more \"trailblazing\" to explore and reveal.<br><br>...<br><br>Aglaea demonstrated genuine gratitude towards us for helping to defeat Nikador. She prepared a generous gift and invited {NICKNAME} and I to a discussion at the Hero's Bath, where she indicated she would like to ally with us. As we discussed the matter, we met Hyacine from the Twilight Courtyard, a healer who had concluded her work trip in Okhema. With Aglaea's suggestion, {NICKNAME} and Castorice decided to go back to the Grove together with this new friend and complete the diplomatic tasks given to them by Aglaea. I will, instead, stay at Okhema and tidy my notes. However, this trip to the Grove by {NICKNAME} is not as peaceful as we had imagined.<br><br>As they were about to head out, Trianne found someone at Okhema's outskirts who was wounded by the black tide and in critical condition. Hyacine had to temporarily remain in Okhema to look after this patient while Trianne, Castorice, and {NICKNAME} went ahead to the Grove of Epiphany, an esteemed academic institution worshiping {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#}. However, when the three of them arrived at their destination, the Grove had long sunk into an eerie silence. {NICKNAME} and the others took some effort to enter the Grove only to discover that something was wrong in that place — The creatures of the black tide were wandering everywhere within the Grove.<br><br>I fear that the Grove is unlikely to survive unscathed after this calamity. A man named Anaxa was among the Chrysos Heirs stationed at the Grove, and he had left clues via alchemy and guided {NICKNAME}'s group into the depths of the Grove to check on Cerces's Coreflame. While they explored the location, they encountered a mysterious individual calling themselves Calypso. That person claimed to be the head of the Grove of Epiphany's Seven Sages and had saved Anaxa. However, after careful observation, Castorice exposed Calypso's true identity as {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#}. Cerces admitted to this and asked {NICKNAME}'s group to help them reach Anaxa, so they could fuse the Coreflame again to catch the culprit behind the annihilation of the Grove — the nameless black-robed swordmaster.<br><br>After an intense battle, {NICKNAME}'s group safely returned to Okhema with Anaxa, and I learned about what happened at the Grove from Phainon. In fact, Phainon seemed rather odd when he mentioned that black-robed swordmaster. It was as if he had some history with that individual. Perhaps he will explain that connection to everyone in the future.<br><br>...<br><br>I can hardly believe it, but a Kremnoan named Krateros abducted Trinnon and tried to enter the Vortex of Genesis to accept Strife's trial. He failed and was apprehended on the spot by Aglaea. No wonder Mydei had been so hesitant on the subject of accepting the authority of Strife — Troubles remain within the Kremnoans as a people. Troubles that have not been solved. As to what those troubles are, I fear only Mydei would know. Meanwhile, despite being abducted, Trinnon expressed her understanding towards Krateros's anxiety. She decided to borrow Oronyx's power to restore Krateros' memories from ages past to soothe his unease.<br><br>...<br><br>While at the Abyss, the three Tribbie ladies encountered the black-robed swordmaster who destroyed the Grove — the Flame Reaver. At the cost of exhausting her divine power, Trianne sent Tribbie and Trinnon away from the battlefield. The heroes in the city then met up, after which we decided to split up. Hyacine and I went to look for Trianne's whereabouts, while Aglaea and Castorice remained in the city to prepare for a political crisis. The others prepared their strategies and headed to Castrum Kremnos to stop the Flame Reaver together. The Chrysos Heirs must all give their all when facing this unknown foe.<br><br>...<br><br>During this time, Mydei finally made up his mind and successfully passed the trial of the Coreflame, ascending into the demigod of Strife and making a lance throw that decided the battle's outcome at Castrum Kremnos, defeating the Flame Reaver completely. This campaign ended with the Chrysos Heirs' triumph. Mydei opted to return home alone and inherit the duty of fighting back the black tide from Nikador, becoming the shield for Okhema and all of Amphoreus.<br><br>Though we won the fight against the Flame Reaver, we have lost Trianne forever. At Trianne's funeral, Phainon made a request to Tribbie, hoping to witness the moment she first embarked on her Flame-Chase Journey. With the power of {NICKNAME}, they journeyed to the past of the Abyss of Fate — to the sanctum of prophecy, Janusopolis. There, they witnessed how Tribios took the Coreflame of Passage, received Janus's divinity, and fled this Sanctum of Tripartite Prophecy that had held her captive for decades to pursue her destiny.<br><br>I'm not sure whether they were influenced by the beliefs of the Chrysos Heirs, but {NICKNAME} and Mem have volunteered to accept the trial of {RUBY_B#Time Titan}Oronyx{RUBY_E#}. Though they are just passersby, they are willing to connect their destiny with that of the world they are travelling through. Perhaps this is trailblaze's inescapable fate...<br><br>..."

The veil of Oronyx shows signs of being rent asunder, revealing rifts akin to glowing embers flickering amidst the eternal night.

The Okheman Fate Compass has, too, gone haywire, its pointers spinning wildly as though manipulated by an unseen hand.<br><br>Even worse, the Thief Star is appearing with increasing frequency. According to ancient prophecies, this signals that Zagreus' schemes are currently taking effect, but I have a feeling that there's more to it than meets the eye. The paths of the Thief Star hide a chaotic pattern we've never seen before.<br><br>The Coreflame of Janus is also acting up.

Let's cut to the chase: The ███████ era suggested in the prophecies of █████████ could be a world apart from what we envisioned. While poring over the ancient prophecy texts, I stumbled upon a startling discovery — certain phrases had been deliberately altered. For example, the original text \"Re█████ to the Era Chrysea\" has been changed to \"Returning to the Era Chrysea.\" This minute difference disquiets me, but what truly chills me to the bone is the question — who, or what group, is secretly meddling with these texts?<br><br>What unsettles me even more is that as I was organizing the Archive of Prophecies, I discovered that the records about █████████ are slowly vanishing. It's not due to human intervention. Rather, the ink seems to be fading away on its own, as though time itself is erasing that part of history.<br>I have a hunch that the Three Titans of Fate have already glimpsed into this unfolding. That's probably why the prophecies of Oronyx have become increasingly obscure, the scales of Talanton have lost their balance, and the gates of Janus now quiver with unease.<br>— Helena<br><br>Fifth Missive<br>Dear Sisters,<br>The gravity of our circumstances now demands decisive action. In my meditation, I had a chilling vision — the world being engulfed by a dark tide. It's not the Thanatos' River of Souls we're dealing with, but something far older and more wicked.<br><br>I propose the following:<br>1. Secretly reinforce the seals of the Temple of the Three Fates.<br>2. Make three copies of all prophecy documents and distribute them for safekeeping.<br>3. Find and protect those \"special\" children.<br>4. Brace ourselves for the worst-case scenario.<br><br>Remember: If the world is indeed marching towards its doom, our mission is to safeguard the fires of hope. Even if the threads of destiny have been corrupted, we must do our utmost to protect the last untainted golden thread.<br><br>May the Three Titans of Fate bless Amphoreus.

But one stood out: Clitun. This kid lost his parents when he was young and was raised by the kindness of the villagers. It's no wonder his eyes burn with fierce determination. In my experience, kids who endure hardship from a young age often grow into something extraordinary, if they can just make it through.<br><br>During the routine pep talk, I made a point of saying, \"From the moment you set foot in this military camp, you all become one thing: The swords of Nikador. Swords don't think. They just need to stay sharp and be ready.\"<br><br>I hope Clitun gets the message.<br><br>Training Month, Day 3<br>We kicked off with basic physical training today.<br>The recruits had plenty to gripe about the pomegranate juice, saying it was too astringent. One pampered young master even asked why it wasn't served chilled. In response, I doubled their portions — this beverage is a basic testament of honor. Those who can't stomach it don't deserve to wear the uniform of a Kremnoan warrior.<br>Clitun truly shone today. He volunteered to carry twice the usual weight during training. I let him, knowing that a soldier who seeks out challenges will undoubtedly go far.<br><br>Today's training schedule:<br>1. 50 round-trip hill sprints.<br>2. Weighted combat training.<br>3. Weapon maintenance before bed.<br><br>Training Month, Day 7<br>Had to deal with a bit of a scuffle today. Two recruits got into a fight over a practice shield. It's a good thing for Kremnoan soldiers to compete for honor, but these two picked the wrong moment and place for it.<br><br>Punishment: Each will carry triple the weight of rock plates and march around the camp until dawn, and I've ordered the shield to be placed in front of them. If you crave it so much, let it serve as a constant reminder throughout your march.<br><br>Training Month, Day 12<br>Incident Record: Soldier #07, Jansen, fell off a cliff during training.<br>Follow-Up Action: Inscribed his name on the stone monument at the training ground, as per tradition.<br><br>This is the second fatal accident this month. The recruits' spirits were lowered, but I reassured them, \"To die during training is a great honor, far better than dying in your bed.\"<br><br>Training Month, Day 15<br>I've received an inquiry from the Inspector: The accident rate is too high. My response: Since the establishment of Castrum Kremnos, our mission has been to forge weapons, not train soldiers. Weapons undergo quenching, honing, and even breaking, all to emerge stronger through recasting.<br><br>Seeing Clitun's performance today, I know I was on the right track. He broke three iron swords in combat training yet remained unyielding. This truly embodies the spirit of a Kremnos warrior.<br><br>Training Month, Day 20<br>Disciplinary Records:<br>1. Soldier #13 neglected weapon maintenance; punishment: Night running.<br>2. Soldier #04 showed cowardice during training; punishment: Contemplation against the wall.<br>3. Soldier #21 breached armor maintenance protocols; punishment: One-rank salary deduction.<br>Today, I presented the squad with a shield that embodies the true spirit of Castrum Kremnos. This shield, forged in the fires of countless battles, still holds its blade-like sharpness. I emphasized, \"One day, you'll wield a shield like this. But only if you survive the trials ahead.\"<br><br>Training Month, Day 25<br>Clitun defeated a veteran in the martial competition. The veterans were outraged, seeing it as a display of disrespect from a mere recruit. Yet, I support this act. Castrum Kremnos doesn't seek humble warriors. We crave those who hunger for victory, warriors whose hearts burn with the desire to win.<br><br>I've recommended Clitun to the examiners of the Godshield Brigade. His outstanding performance earns him this opportunity.<br><br>Training Month, Final Day<br>Monthly Evaluation Completed:<br>1. Survivors: 19 (Qualified)<br>2. Injured: 12 (Below expectations)<br>3. Promoted: 3 (Led by Clitun)<br>Overall Assessment: These recruits are packed with potential. They've begun to grasp the essence of the Castrum Kremnos spirit. The blazing fire in their eyes speaks volumes.<br>When I was just a recruit, my drillmaster told me this: \"Castrum Kremnos has no use for living cowards.\" Today, I've echoed those same words to these recruits. I see glimpses of my past self reflected in their faces.<br>War has no need for perfect men. Only those who dare to face death will be accepted. And behold, my recruits are such men — they stand ready.<br><br>Monthly Diary (New Cycle)<br>New mission: Escort the supply team to the border fortress. This will mark the recruits' baptism of fire.<br>I kept quiet about the fact that three teams had already bitten the dust on this very route in the past month. They don't need the extra baggage. Kremnos warriors live by one code: Fight till the end.<br><br>Monthly Preparation Records (New Cycle):<br>1. Restock pomegranate juice supplies.<br>2. Arrange weapon handover.<br>3.

I, Ptolemy, have studied most of the books in the archives of Castrum Kremnos. In the royal biographies, most are focused on praising the current rulers, filled with eulogistic words, yet short of insightful advice. To fill this gap, I've endeavored to trace the 2,500-year history of Castrum Kremnos, documenting the dynasty's rise and decline, and the great deeds of its rulers, to preserve its enduring spirit and the legacy of Nikador for future generations to come.<br><br>...<br><br>My work, <i>Kings of Kremnos</i>, is yet to be completed. As I follow the lone detachment, with each day uncertain and the future's fate unknown, I may never have the chance to see the new king of Kremnos ascend to the throne. Should I fall before then, I leave it to future hands to complete this work.<br><br>...<br><br><b><i>Volume One</i></b><br>At the dawn of the Era Bellica, Nikador forged hundreds of warriors and weapons, determined to claim the heads of the Foundation Titans. While the people of Amphoreus trembled in fear, one warlike tribe was awestruck by the Lance of Fury's glory. United under their light, they rallied to follow Nikador's path. The tribe leader was Gorgo, a warrior of unparalleled valor. Armed with a single shield and spear, they charged fearlessly into hundreds of foes. When they returned triumphant, the enemy commander's head at their belt, their breastplate shone unscathed.<br><br>The battle between the Strife Titan Nikador and the Sky Titan Aquila was long and arduous. In pursuit of the hundred-eyed giant bird above the clouds, Nikador's divine body often streaked from one city to another. Therefore, Gorgo's tribe had to march day and night, guided only by the earth-shaking battle roars of Nikador. During these relentless journeys, Gorgo and their followers traversed many lands and had countless wondrous encounters. After extensive research, I've chosen to record some of the most credible tales.<br><br>...<br><br>Gorgo's most renowned feat is their barehanded battle against the great lion of Tretos. At the time, their tribe was passing through the city of Tretos, where the local lord hosted a banquet in their honor. However, no meat was served. The lord explained that a fierce lion had long occupied the outskirts of the city. All meat was regularly sent to appease the beast's hunger, for if its hunger went unsated, it would raid the city, devouring its vulnerable inhabitants.<br><br>Gorgo's tribe revered the warrior spirit of Nikador and despised the idea of settling in one place for a life of peace. Initially, they intended to leave this land to its own fate. However, after days of travel without a single taste of meat, their hunger became unbearable. Driven by desperation, they ventured to the outskirts of Tretos to hunt the lion.<br><br>Under the scorching sun, Gorgo and their followers, armed with spears and shields, ventured into the plain to confront the fearsome beast. Unlike ordinary lions with dull coats, this Tretos lion was extraordinary — its form as massive as a city gate, its fur gleaming like a golden flame, shining under the sunlight like a colossus gilded in gold. At the sight of this magnificent creature, Gorgo's grit ignited. Casting aside their spear and shield, they instructed their followers to stand down. They would face the beast alone, barehanded, for an ultimate battle of strength.<br><br>The duel was over in moments. As the lion emerged from its lair, Gorgo struck swiftly, effortlessly bringing the beast down. With a few swift blows, they shattered several of its joints. Though the lion lay defeated, its thunderous roar still echoed, enough to shatter the innards of ordinary folks. Yet Gorgo and their followers, hardened by years of following Nikador and enduring the terrifying battle cries of Titans, felt no fear. It is said that for over a century after the lion's death, its dying roar continued to reverberate across the outskirts of Tretos.<br><br>...<br><br>Years of pursuing Nikador had left the entire tribe utterly exhausted. It was then that they arrived at a city devoted to Oronyx, where the local priests delivered a divine oracle: The Blade of Fury and their pursuers shall forever hang above the earth. After days of deliberation, Gorgo and their followers made a decision. They would build a fortress for Nikador's arrival. When Nikador passed by, their mightiest warrior would stand atop the fortress to halt them. Then the entire tribe would display their indomitable spirit, seeking the Strife Titan's recognition and benediction.<br><br>Months later, the fortress was complete, and Nikador, in pursuit of Aquila, drew near Gorgo's tribe. The entire tribe shouted Nikador's name towards the divine body, but the Strife Titan, fixated on hurling spears at Aquila, paid them no heed. Seeing that Nikador was about to leave, Gorgo had an idea. They rushed into the storeroom and retrieved the head of the Tretos lion — a monstrous trophy so fearsome that perhaps even Thanatos refused to claim it. Remarkably, years had passed, yet the head remained unrotten.<br><br>With a few strides, Gorgo leapt onto the fortress wall, raising the lion's head high above their forehead. Using the beast's hollow skull as a resonator, they let out a deafening roar. Though not so powerful as Nikador's battle cry, it was enough to halt the Strife Titan. As Nikador turned to look back, Gorgo flung their arm and hurled the head with such force that it embedded itself in the wall. Leading their warriors, they once again shouted praises to the Lance of Fury. The proud Strife Titan finally acknowledged their resolve and bestowed upon the tribe a blade forged by the Titan's own hand. To honor the Titan's gift, the tribe began to build a fortress around it with giant stones. Over time, a mobile citadel, known as Castrum Kremnos, took shape. Gorgo was crowned its first king, revered by later generations as the Founder of Kremnos and the Lion-Slayer King.<br><br>..."

Imagine a master potter effortlessly surpassing his apprentices — experience usually counts. But surviving the black tide once doesn't guarantee safety the next time. Confronting this seemingly sentient natural disaster — though this idea is not confirmed, the black tide always strikes at our weakest points, and that's why I'm inclined to believe in this proposition — requires more than just relying on past experience and habitual thinking. Doing so will only lead to greater losses.<br><br>As we have already discussed, the hazards posed by the black tide encompass two major components:<br><br>(I) The inexplicable black tide itself<br><br>(II) The terrifying creatures that emerge from the black tide<br><br>When the black tide is relatively small in scale, we can temporarily diminish it by eliminating the monsters it spawns. However, if the monsters emerge faster than we can deploy forces to counter them, the black tide quickly expands beyond our ability to manage. This makes \"assessing the black tide's scale\" a critical challenge: If we underestimate it, a considerable number of our excellent warriors may die in vain due to overconfidence. Conversely, if we overestimate it, we will waste resources on relocating people and assets, which will inevitably disrupt normal life and cause unnecessary panic, thereby hampering the smooth functioning of the city-state.<br><br><i>(...)</i><br><br>Among all the city-states of Amphoreus, two modes stand out for their relatively effective methods of countering the black tide:<br><br>(I) Castrum Kremnos<br>We are all familiar with this situation: We utilize the great mobility of Castrum Kremnos to deploy forces proactively, aiming to subdue the black tide as soon as it appears. While this approach has proven effective due to our efficient military mobilization, the steadily increasing casualties in each battle serve as a grim reminder that even with Nikador's blessings, whether Castrum Kremnos can consistently win such wars remains an open question.<br><br>(II) Okhema<br>To the Kremnoans, the Okhemans seem to have done nothing at all. They simply hide behind Kephale, as if they were still living in the Era Chrysea, with no sense of crisis or honor. However, I must point out that the Okhemans' wit lies exactly in leveraging their strengths without shame. They achieved a result similar to ours in battling against the black tide, but at a much smaller cost. (Seen from their perspective, their reliance on the protection of Kephale is hardly a flaw, a point I believe most would agree with.)<br><br>To sum up, both Castrum Kremnos and its rival city, Okhema, have their own strengths and shortcomings in confronting the black tide. Obviously, it doesn't take a man of extraordinary wit to realize that the deep-rooted systemic flaws cannot be fixed with temporary measures in no time. Yet the black tide's threat persists, and it's growing so fast that we suspect soon even Nikador won't be able to handle it alone.<br><br>Given the above-mentioned analysis, we may reach the following conclusion:<br><br>Before the black tide grows too powerful to handle, we must unite the power of Castrum Kremnos and Okhema. The smaller cities won't make much of a difference. We have three possible ways to achieve this:<br><br>1. Castrum Kremnos annexes Okhema, taking full control of its resources and strengths.<br><br>2. Okhema annexes Castrum Kremnos, taking full control of its resources and strengths.<br><br>3. Castrum Kremnos and Okhema merge into a united entity with the spirit of Kremnos.<br><br><i>(...)</i>"

Therefore, relying on the charisma of a single leader is far from enough to accurately extend the Titan's will to everyone in an army, let alone a city. A king cannot possibly monitor every development on every front at all times. Yet coordination — or, more specifically, the ability to launch attacks at the right time and in the right place — is the single most crucial factor in securing battlefield advantages for any army. This is where the importance of strategic advisory becomes evident: Advisors are the commanding officer's most indispensable aides. Through close collaboration, they provide intelligence, craft plans, organize units to implement battle arrangements, and offer valuable counsel to the commanding officer. They must ensure that the commanding officer maintains a focus on strategic and operational levels, rather than on specific tactics, such as redeploying a squadron fifty paces east, thereby enabling wise decision-making.<br><br>War is a systemic endeavor, one that maximizes the use of violence against each other. Some foolish city-states dream of finding an ingenious method to achieve decisive victories and win the enemy's heartfelt submission without significant casualties. Such fantasies not only disgrace the Titan they revere but often result in even greater losses for their compatriots at the hands of the enemy. In my opinion, the root of this folly lies in these city-state leaders' disregard for advisory work, along with their irreverence toward Nikador. Anyone with practical knowledge of strategic advisory and the complexity of military conflict understands that there is no path to success without the application of violence. Even diplomatic activities — often mild and friendly as they may seem — involve military calculations beyond the comprehension of the ignorant.<br><br>In recent years, Castrum Kremnos has witnessed the rise of a dangerous misconception: That war is a divine authority of Nikador and that it will help us obtain whatever we desire as long as we, the ordinary people, demonstrate sufficient — though often self-destructive — devotion to it. This is not what Nikador wants. On the contrary, Nikador desires that we actively engage in all the struggles of survival, using our own wits to secure our place in the world rather than having them do it for us. \"Valorous death before glorious return\" — this motto does not call for us to die senseless deaths on the battlefield. What it truly indicates is that one should only fall while striving for a cause the person deems worthy, specifically in the pursuit of glory for Castrum Kremnos. It signifies giving one's all and fighting for the \"meaning of one's existence in the world.\" In light of this, I believe the greatest value of this course lies in learning to face future conflicts with composure, understanding the principles of solidarity through the study of strategic advisory, and securing the highest chances of defeating your enemies.<br><br>In this course, we will explore the roles and responsibilities of advisors, the necessary qualities and capabilities they must possess, the procedures and methods of strategic advisory, the relationship between advisors and commanding officers, and the various roles of advisors during peacetime training and wartime engagement. This is the eighth edition of this course's textbook since its establishment. It now includes substantial updates on practical guidance for combating the black tide. Special thanks go to Krateros of the King's Aegis, who generously provided numerous valuable materials and insights for this revision, including this very foreword."

Instead, they believed that the Titans were controlled by an unspeakable higher being, a machine with divinity if you will, and manipulated by something as abstract as numbers. This editor is of the opinion that this heresy does not warrant any discussion, but since the blasphemy promoted the importance of numbers to this world to an unparalleled level, it does have some recording value as an anecdote. Therefore, this editor took the time to interview a certain foreign scholar seeking refuge in Okhema (name withheld for privacy concerns) and included two interesting foreign ideas for the readers to judge their value.</i><br><br><br>Numerophile: Order<br>The Order faction of the Numerophiles thinks that everything in this world can be reduced to integers and their operations. For example, they think that the Three Titans of Foundation ({RUBY_B#Sky Titan}Aquila{RUBY_E#}, {RUBY_B#Earth Titan}Georios{RUBY_E#}, and {RUBY_B#Ocean Titan}Phagousa{RUBY_E#}) are personifications of addition, the Three Titans of Creation ({RUBY_B#Romance}Mnestia{RUBY_E#}, {RUBY_B#Worldbearing Titan}Kephale{RUBY_E#}, and {RUBY_B#Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#}) multiplication, the Three Titans of Calamity ({RUBY_B#Trickery Titan}Zagreus{RUBY_E#}, {RUBY_B#Strife Titan}Nikador{RUBY_E#}, and {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}) subtraction and division, and the Three Titans of Fate ({RUBY_B#Time Titan}Oronyx{RUBY_E#}, {RUBY_B#Law Titan}Talanton{RUBY_E#}, and {RUBY_B#Passage Titan}Janus{RUBY_E#}) logarithms and exponents.<br>As mathematical research advanced and people realized that logic operations might be more basic than arithmetic, Order Numerophiles developed a new version of the Titan personifications: The Three Titans of Foundation represent conjunction, the Three Titans of Creation disjunction, the Three Titans of Calamity negation, the Three Titans of Fate exclusive disjunction. The attribution of the mysterious and seldom used exclusive disjunction to the Fate Titans might be the only intriguing aspect of this ridiculous theory, if it can even be called one.<br>Generally, while Order Numerophiles' faith is questionable, they are excellent law-abiding citizens by Okhema standards. Should the readers encounter outlanders with such predilections, do not fret, as life in the holy city will guide them to eventually abandon their narrow views of the Titans, an unfortunate result of assessing the Titans with only one academic subject, and return to the right path.<br><br>Numerophile: Chaotic<br>As the name suggests, the Chaotic Numerophiles see integers — symbols of order in the eyes of the Order Numerophiles — as superficial, merely a byproduct of a deeper reality. They believe that irrational numbers represent the true essence of existence, with pi and base of natural logarithm possessing greater sanctity than the Twelve Titans. They argue that, just like the integers, the Twelve Titans are illusions created by natural structures. They propose the existence of a hidden, unknowable \"Thirteenth Titan\" behind the Twelve, one that is indescribable by either language or numbers and beyond human comprehension.<br>Therefore, we can actually see a paradoxical and interesting phenomenon here: On the one hand, the Chaotic Numerophiles deny the reality of all the Titans, believing that these living wonders are merely illusions to their senses. On the other hand, they believe in an unknowable {RUBY_B#Thirteenth Titan}\"One True God\"{RUBY_E#} that grants the world chaos, from which order emerges. (Editor's Note: This is, of course, from their perspective.)<br>Please be reminded: As proven by what happened to other city-states, the Chaotic Numerophiles are often instigators of worsening black tide. They do not revere any of the Titans that actually exist in the world, but absurdly believe in a non-existent so-called \"Thirteenth Titan.\" This arrogance and distortion that diverges from reality is precisely one of the major reasons for the constant strife in the real world. To all the good people of Okhema, let this serve as a solemn warning: Do not stray from the teachings of Kephale, and under no circumstances should you dare to defy the power of the Titans.<br><br>"

A fissure in the rocks in the northwestern corner that must be reinforced<br>2. The underground river might impact the foundation<br>3. The volcano is dormant, but the magma is still flowing<br><br>Overall Plan<br>The arena is divided into four areas. From bottom to top, they are:<br>1. Quarry Zone (-300 to -200 feet)<br>2. Sculpting Zone (-200 to -100 feet)<br>3. Soul-Forging Zone (-100 to 0 feet)<br>4. Contest Zone (0 to 200 feet above ground)<br><br>The areas are connected by a spiraling elevator with a mechanical core powered by magma. We learned this technique from the Sons of Daedalus, but two accidents took place due to our incomplete mastery.<br>The first accident happened in Year 3847 of the Light Calendar, when a gear in the elevator warped under the high heat and stopped the system. There were no casualties, but it was a lesson well-learned. Going forward, mountain copper was used to forge core components. It is a rare metal, but it remains stable under high temperatures.<br><br>Quarry Zone<br>This zone was constructed a long time ago, and must be renovated. The biggest challenge is to create enough space without affecting the structural integrity of the mountain. We employed our usual drilling procedures, but encountered an accident at -270 feet. The vibrations caused the underground river to change its path, and the invading vapor triggered an explosion when it reached the magma, killing three craftsmen. May Nikador bless their souls.<br>After the accident, we used a detection pole to ascertain the waterways before drilling, and placed irrigation pipes at key positions. The pipes were made from heat-resistant ceramic from the Ceramic Craftsmen's Guild in Castrum Kremnos.<br><br>Sculpting Zone<br>The Sculpting Zone is an area that showcases the highest level of craftsmanship of Kremnoan masters. We designed an automated sculpting system powered by the heat from the magma. Hot steam that powers the mechanical arms is delivered to each workbench through copper pipes, and these arms do the basic sculpting based on pre-set tracks, boosting efficiency tremendously.<br>However, during an accident in Year 3845 of the Light Calendar, the pipes burst, and the steam jet destroyed three statues and critically injured two craftsmen. Subsequent investigation showed that the copper pipes were fatigued under the constant heat. We switched to using an alloy of mountain copper and ordinary copper for pipes, and increased their durability.<br><br>Soul-Forging Zone<br>This zone must be expanded to accommodate the increasing ritual demands. The expansion perfectly combined construction techniques with ritual demands, with heat-conducting obsidian socketed on the floor of the ring-shaped hall and a complicated network of heat pipes under them. During ceremonies, the heat of the magma travels through the network of pipes to heat up the hall and help with injecting divinity into the statue.<br>The special dome design should also be mentioned here: Several hundred holes were drilled at the top, forming the spear of Nikador. When the sun shines through them, light falls on the center of the altar.<br><br>Contest Zone<br>The most important mechanism in this zone is the rise and fall of the greatsword in the center. This sword is both a support beam of the building and a divine weapon that decides life and death. A complicated mechanism connects the greatsword to the underground magma, which powers the sword. When the blade rises, the floor of the arena changes with it.<br>However, during a ceremony in Year 3829 of the Light Calendar, the system broke down and the greatsword was stuck in midair. The gladiatorial fight was already over, so there were no casualties. A detailed check showed that the impurities in the magma had blocked the transmission. Subsequently, a filter was added to the system with a rigorous maintenance procedure.<br><br>Maintenance Suggestions<br>1. Add a backup irrigation system in the Quarry Zone.<br>2. The steam pipes in the Sculpting Zone should be checked monthly.<br>3. The heat-conducting layer on the bottom of the altar in the Soul-Forging Zone should be changed periodically.<br>4. The materials used to repair the cracks in the Contest Zone should be improved accordingly.<br><br>Afterword<br>After many setbacks, the arena was completed during Year 2523 of the Light Calendar, which was more than a thousand years from now. Future Kremnos engineers should keep up with annual maintenance to repay Nikador's favor. This log is both a record and a warning, and may newcomers be inspired to improve arena maintenance and keep Nikador's glory aflame.<br><br><i>\"May the flames of war burn forever, may the steel howl endlessly, and may the hot blood never be extinguished.\"</i>"

                "Desc": "Foreword<br>Pomegranate juice originated from Castrum Kremnos. It was not just a beverage, but a cultural symbol as well. This paper will attempt to examine the origin and the evolution of this tradition and create a comprehensive record for latter generations.<br><br>I. Historical Origin<br>Ancient Indiscretion<br>According to the <i>Chronicles of War</i> located in the archives in the Council of Elders in Castrum Kremnos, followers of Nikador had the unfortunate practice of drinking their enemies' blood during the early days of Era Bellica. At that time, Kremnoan believed that drinking the blood of powerful enemies would grant them the valiance of the deceased. There was no evidence, but it was a popular tradition in the army.<br><br>The Enigma of Phagousa<br>Around Year 2600 of the Light Calendar, a critical event changed the tradition. A conflict broke out between Castrum Kremnos and the Seaside States, and Nikador traveled with their troops to conquer three cities in succession. After the war, Nikador gave the cruel request for the defeated to offer the blood of their residents, or they would suffer from divine punishment.<br>According to the <i>Story of the Tide</i>, Phagousa, the Ocean Titan, appeared to save the poor residents. They ordered their followers to drink pomegranate juice instead, and imbued their powers in the juice. Nikador was unable to tell the difference between pomegranate and blood, and even praised the beverage for its flavor.<br><br>II. Change<br>Replacement Proposal<br>Interestingly, this sparked an intense debate in the Council of Elders. The conservative faction believed that giving up blood consumption was a sign of weakness, whereas the progressive faction claimed that Nikador's approval of pomegranate juice carried great significance.<br>Ultimately, General Krasus left a statement that signified the change: \"We all know the wisdom of Nikador and Phagousa. Pomegranates have the same color as blood and taste like blood, so isn't its juice fitting for a warrior? Consuming large quantities of pomegranate juice before a battle would demonstrate our valiance and carry on Nikador's legacy. Is this not a perfect solution?\"<br><br>Established As Law<br>In Year 2650 of the Light Calendar, the Council of Elders formally declared that pomegranate juice would replace blood, and created relevant rituals and rules. This signified a critical change in the beverage culture of Castrum Kremnos.<br><br>III. Recipe Evolution<br>Traditional Recipe<br>The recipe was extremely simple during its infancy:<br>Freshly squeezed pomegranate juice<br>A pinch of salt<br>An iron vessel for storage (for the rusty flavor)<br><br>Military Recipe<br>The \"empowered\" version popular in the military:<br>Freshly squeezed pomegranate juice<br>Minced raw ginger<br>Sea salt<br>Dendrobium catenatum (this version allegedly enhanced stamina, and was often consumed before marching)<br><br>Ritual Recipe<br>To be used during important rituals:<br>Wild pomegranate (must be picked from a battlefield)<br>Honey (represents Phagousa's gift)<br>An iron vessel for soaking<br>Blessings from a priest<br><i>Note: In modern times, this recipe is used during important ceremonies such as the Rite of the Shield.</i><br><br>Modern Controversy<br>During recent years, a group led by a famous warrior created a new recipe by adding goat's milk and cheese, giving the beverage a light pink hue. The conservatives on the Council of Elders expressed their discontent at this change. However, research showed that dairy was included in Phagousa's original recipe, so maybe the new recipe was actually closer to the beverage's original form.<br><br>IV. Ritual Significance<br>Military<br>1. Before an expedition: The army consumes the beverage together to show solidarity.<br>2. Upon a triumphant return: Generals drink first, and their subordinates drink together afterward.<br>3. At the funerals for the deceased: Pomegranate juice is sprinkled on shields to symbolize the return of these soldiers.<br><br>Civilian<br>1. Coming of Age Ceremony: Youths drink pure pomegranate juice for the first time.<br>2. Rite of the Shield: Parents drink with their children when the former depart.<br>3. Alliance Ceremony: The entities creating the alliance drink from the same cup.<br><br>V. Revelation<br>The evolution of the tradition symbolizes the advancement of the Castrum Kremnos civilization. The growth of a people can be seen in the change from barbaric blood rituals to elegant ceremonies. Phagousa imparted the wisdom that change did not necessarily mean leaving the tradition behind, and that it could be seen as a more sophisticated way of passing on the tradition.<br>What must be noted here, however, is that the key to pomegranate juice replacing blood lies in the fact that the core concept of the warrior culture was preserved — the valiance that transcended even death — and that is why Castrum Kremnos still stands tall today.<br><br>Conclusion<br>May the warriors who drink the pomegranate juice forever remember the history and the glory contained within. As remarked by an ancient sage, \"pomegranate juice is not blood, but it carries a deeper significance than blood.\"<br><br><i>Afterword: A special thanks to the archives of Castrum Kremnos and Council of Elders for supporting the research.</i>"

This hereby records its grandest Twelve Trials, which I hope will allow you to <s>understand my great love for dromases</s> evangelize the repute of the dromas Heracles.<br><br>Battling the Verax Leo:<br>The fabled Verax Leo that does not slip on its words was thwarted by Heracles! Against the Verax Leo's acerbic inquiries, Heracles successfully silenced it with sheer strength, and after paying the compensation fee, adorned its saddle with the lion's mask.<br><br>Little chimera rescue:<br>Hydra was a wounded little chimera, losing eight of its nine tails from black tide corruption. 'Twas fortunate Heracles lent a hand! It lunged toward this little chimera and carried it on its back, successfully breaking through the black tide's encirclement.<br><br>Liberating Aquila's hunter:<br>Hunter Selene, self-proclaimed recipient of Aquila's blessing, had been pursuing a deer of prophecy for many years. The eagle-eyed Heracles sighted a pair of antlers among the black tide's vestiges, and successfully persuaded this hunter to abandon a mission that could never be accomplished.<br><br>Helping Oleinus' farmers:<br>Oleinus' farmers suffered from a wild boar invasion. They rampaged throughout the countryside, fleeting and erratically violent. The erudite Heracles procured ample fruits to lure them away, and defeated them in one fell swoop outside the village.<br><br>Cleaning the Icaria dromases' home:<br>Icaria's dromas stable lacked upkeep, and was infamous for its filthy state. The local dromases tolerated the threat of sickness to varying degrees, but never fear! The brave Heracles dislodged the riverbanks on both flanks of the dromases' abode — water from the two artificial inlets gushed the place clean, and the dromases could once again enjoy a life of cleanliness.<br><br>Driving away the Stymphalian avians:<br>There lived oddly-visaged birds with metal plumes on Stymphalia, frequently stealing olive oil and attacking oil mills and presses. The dromas Heracles invited the locals to stand on its back and pelt them with slingshots. After three days of non-stop stone showers, the birds were finally driven away.<br><br>Finding Handak's prized bull:<br>Handak's pedigree bulls were the pride of the local town, but a certain purebred bull had \"eloped\" with an ordinary spotted cow... 'Twas fortuitous that Heracles unleashed its unmatched might and forcefully dragged the obstinate animal back to the cattle pen in Handak city. Appreciative of Heracles' deed, the locals even let it revel in unlimited quantities of Handak's red earth!<br><br>Taming Odressian's frenzied dromases:<br>Due to the negligence of Odressian's dromas caretaker, red earth tainted by the black tide was fed to them, causing the four dromases there to go berserk. Fortunately, the mighty Heracles was with us — it single-handedly held down this quartet of enraged dromases till all traces of the black tide were fully digested in their systems, returning their mental states to their usual docility.<br><br>Winning the saddle blessed by Kephale:<br>Besides braving the dangers of the world, Heracles is also a champion dromas renowned by all in Okhema! When the city organized its inaugural Dromas Games, as the top seed that registered first, Heracles clinched top spots in all participating events, convincingly triumphing over the other five contenders, and winning a sacred saddle blessed by Kephale (Sponsor: Mr. Iason).<br><br>Bringing back Kadir's lost dromases:<br>A trio of Kadir city's dromases were stolen away by a fraudster in the dead of night. Using its acute olfactory senses, Heracles adroitly pinpointed the direction in which the culprit fled, recovering the lost dromases in a mountain ravine, and aided the guards in apprehending the fraudster.<br><br>Attaining the Grove of Epiphany's reward apple:<br>Okhema's second Dromas Games was sponsored and organized by an anonymous enthusiast of the sport from the Grove, with its prize being a redsoil apple specially produced by the Grove of Epiphany. Inevitably, Heracles did not disappoint its supporters, emerging champion, and happily wolfed down this priceless synthetic apple.<br><br>Assisting in extracting black tide creation samples:<br>This was Heracles' most incredible trial till now! It was all thanks to its long neck that the people managed to retrieve a precious sample from the edge of the all-annihilating black tide, accomplishing a mission that even the Grove deemed nigh impossible. The sole lament was Heracles' nonchalance throughout the ordeal that everyone failed to grasp the peril of this quest...<br><br>The above is the Grand Trial of Twelve that Heracles the dromas performed! I trust that in the near future, this list will only be extended to thirteen, fourteen... till it reaches twenty-four feats!<br>"

                "Desc": "<i>\"Merchants may obsess over profit, but rules are required regardless to maintain balance.\" — Unknown Priest of Talanton</i><br><br>Balance Coins, the smallest unit of trade decreed by Talanton, as well as their gift to humanity. In the present world, Balance Coins take the form of tiny gravel-like weights that can be mixed into bigger weights with any amount like clay. It is because of this that a single Balance Coin simply can't be carried, and trade between city-states requires dromas transportation to move obscene weights of currency. But no one can deny that this linear calculation method is indeed very \"fair.\"<br><br>The history of Balance Coins can be traced back to the ancient Era Chrysea's nascent period. Before that, city-states bartered using objects of Titan worship, such as shells, feathers, redsoil clay blocks, etc. As the city-states' supplies became more abundant, along with increasing demand for inter-city trade, merchants urgently needed some common equivalent as a medium of exchange. Gold, silver, and other precious metals came into the picture — rare in production quantity, stable in value, and effective in reducing friction during trade. From that point on, trade among the various city-states gradually gravitated towards precious metals. But even the face value of the lightest copper coin far exceeded the cost of one stalk of vegetable, and this brought much inconvenience to the commonfolk.<br><br>During the economic development of the various city-states, many precious metals streamed into the market each year. We know that the expansion of an economy's scale relies on the support of even more currency. A wealthy merchant and city lord by the name of Midas devised a devious plan exploiting this very concept: What if I possessed all the world's gold? Wouldn't my city-state be unrivaled? He prayed to a certain Titan (some opine that it was Georios, some thought it was Zagreus, and others thought the patron god was Phagousa, but this remains a subject of great debate to this day), attaining the ability to control mineral resources using sinister rituals, and consolidated the entirety of Amphoreus' precious metal deposits in the mountains of his domain. He then announced this circumstance, demanding the other city-states to bend the knee, or there would be a dearth of future precious metals.<br><br>Even so, history always finds a way. After precious metal was monopolized, the city-states did not cease their daily trade — Phagousa's city gathered shells, Georios' city gathered stones, Aquila's city bundled feathers... The people once again returned to the days of barter, and life went on as usual — it was only inter-city trade that was untenable. The irony was that these sundries were portable and plentiful, increasing people's enthusiasm in trade.<br><br>To quell this farce, Talanton overturned the scale, turning bountiful gravel into weights enchanted with divinity, and established it as the common currency across all city-states, which are the Balance Coins of today — encompassing both the benefits and drawbacks of goods and precious metals. With the Scale of Justice being the most trustworthy, with the god's personal guarantee, inter-city trade was very quickly restored. Midas went increasingly mad when he was besieged by Castrum Kremnos, and eventually turned into a statue of pure gold."

Perhaps one day, these logs will help me understand what happened to them. I am deeply vexed as a vet — never have I seen such symptoms. Even the medical journals Grandfather left me did not record such an occurrence.</i><br><br>\"Behavioral Observations\"<br>1. Strange cries during the Curtain-Fall Hour:<br>- The tone is higher than usual, closer to the sound an ancient horn makes, like sobbing<br>- Durations are inconsistent, lasting from a few moments to the entire Curtain-Fall Hour<br>- They will respond to one another in most cases, forming some sort of rhythm<br>- During their wails, their eyes will instinctively gaze in the direction of the horizon<br><br>2. Anomalous Movement:<br>- Caravans report many instances of dromases abruptly stopping<br>- They will stamp at the ground in place, digging at the ground with their forepaws, as if looking for something<br>- Sometimes they will refuse to move until the Curtain-Fall Hour passes<br><i>What is worth paying attention to is that this behavior occurs mostly in locations far away from Okhema</i><br><br>\"Physical Status\"<br>1. Compared to previous measurements<br>- Body temperature slightly increased (+0.3~0.5 degrees)<br>- Faster heartbeat rate (Increased 7~10 times per minute)<br>- Appetite is normal, but with changed preferences to certain ores, exhibiting an unusually high desire for ores deep in the earth<br><br>2. Environmental Reactions:<br>- Refusal to get close to the sand baths that they usually so love<br>- More sensitive to ground tremors<br>- Display depressive behavior when nearing mountains or precipices<br>- But what is strange is that they more frequently touch the ground with their horns and forepaws, like they can hear something<br><i>The most evident change is in their attitude towards certain venues...</i><br><i>I have noticed their eyes have become more glazed and skittish. This reminds me of an ancient fable Grandfather used to tell me: During the Era Creatura, when Georios roused from slumber for the first time, the dromases would exhibit similar symptoms. But that's an ancient tale. It couldn't be a coincidence, could it?</i><br><br>\"Social Behavior\"<br>There is some comfort though:<br>- Their affection for humans hasn't waned<br>- They still allow caretakers to touch and groom their fur<br>- They cozy up to humans even more than usual, regularly seeking out human warmth<br>- Especially during the Curtain-Fall Hour, they will gather in the vicinity of their caretakers<br><br>Treatment Attempts:<br>- Increase daily massage frequency to help them relax<br>- Increase dosage of calming herbs in their drinking water<br>- Change their sandbath method, directly splashing their bodies with sand<br>- Try using music to soothe their nerves<br><i>Current applied measures have not seen visible effects. This leads to my increasing suspicion as to whether their erratic behavior is even caused by an illness.</i><br><br>\"Deductions\"<br>I have begun to contemplate an audacious deduction: Could some innate instinct be awakening within them? Dromases are blessed gifts bequeathed unto us by Georios after all — their connection to this land is unfathomable.<br>A few days ago, I perused some ancient texts about the origin of dromases. According to these records, they were spawned from Georios' spine. If this is true, then their perception of this great land could far surpass our imagination.<br><br>\"Follow Up\"<br>- Continue detailed records of their behavioral change<br>- Seek the opinions of some scholars researching the Titan history<br>- Attempt to ascertain the time patterns of their abnormal behavior<br>- Collect related reports from more caravans<br><br><i>Addendum: Earlier today, I saw the oldest dromas standing alone in a corner, emitting low wails. Its eyes reminded me of the strange phenomenon before the black tide arrived. I have begun to seriously consider maybe we shouldn't treat their abnormal behavior as some kind of sickness, but try to understand with an open mind the message they are trying to tell us.</i>"

They are both the door and the lock that guards it, cleaving the past from the future like a sharp ax.<br><br>During this month, people will discard objects that bear bonds (such as keepsakes from past lovers or deceased family members), declare that they are severing the past, and step forth into the future — this act is completely voluntary.<br><br>Second month — Month of Balance<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Scale of Justice, Talanton<br>The most disciplined of all months, Kephale uses its measurements to dictate the months. During this month, people's daily routines will become more consistent, their moods even, and they are more willing to pass judgment and sign contracts as a result.<br><br>It is said that when there was day and night in the past, the Month of Balance was the only month when the days were as long as nights, because Talanton managed to mediate a truce between Oronyx and Aquila.<br><br>Third Month — Month of Evernight<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Veil of Evernight, Oronyx<br>A month when the sun's shine is dimmer than usual. People doze off more frequently, and their instincts and emotions replace their thought and reason, making it hard to accomplish intricate tasks.<br>It is said that in the past, this month's nights were longer than its days, for Oronyx triumphed over Aquila for undisputed authority over the sky.<br><br>Pillar Season<br>Fourth Month — Month of Cultivation<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Pillar of Stone, Georios<br>The month of spring cultivation, also the busiest month. During this month, the earth is restored into a state most suited for farming. People till the soil, sow the seeds, and offer labor as tribute to the land. Dromases will also be doubly vigorous.<br><br>Fifth Month — Month of Joy<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Chalice of Plenty, Phagousa<br>The month when spring cultivation ends. During this month, spring waters flow, and fishermen flourish. The heaviest workload for the year ended last month, and everyone is reveling in the atmosphere of festivity. This is the best month for brewing and holding celebrations, when people wake up, massage their temples in a daze, then shake their heads and go back to sleep.<br><br>Sixth Month — Month of Everday<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Eye of Twilight, Aquila<br>The hottest month, when the Dawn Device shines even more brightly than usual. The land's flora also works hard to absorb its shine so that people can have a good harvest. Bathed in this radiance, people will feel refreshed and vitalized.<br>It is said that in the past, this month's days were longer than its nights, for Aquila triumphed over Oronyx for undisputed authority over the sky.<br><br>Creation Season<br>Seventh Month — Month of Freedom<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Throne of Worlds, Kephale<br>The month of tranquil peace. There are no major events to attend, nor significant tasks to complete. During this month, people can work on their hobbies, pursue their dreams, and do whatever they wish to do. Just as Kephale created the world, they also allowed its inhabitants to play in their courtyard.<br><br>Eighth Month — Month of Reaping<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Bough of Rift, Cerces<br>The month of the fall harvest. Crops absorbed the light during the Month of Everday, and have grown into their ripest. Similar to the Month of Cultivation, people are busier than usual this month.<br><br>Ninth Month — Month of Weaving<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Chrysalis of Gold, Mnestia<br>The month when the fall harvest is completed. During this month, people will reminisce on their experiences over the year. Mnestia collects everything and weaves them into golden threads of memory. This is a month of family gatherings to enjoy the good times. Leisurely individuals will be weaving at home, and weaving-related festivals will be held this month.<br><br>Calamity Season<br>Tenth Month — Month of Strife<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Lance of Fury, Nikador<br>The first month after production activities are completed. People are liberated from the most important tasks of the year, resulting in surplus labor in society. In the past, the cities typically waged war at this time. This month is also the period when criminal executions and burning offerings in prayer to the gods occur.<br><br>Eleventh Month — Month of Mourning<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Hand of Shadow, Thanatos<br>The month when the cities would gradually fall silent. Wars usually approach their end during this month. People would drag bodies back from the battlefields, bury the dead, and comfort the living. Priests are the busiest this month, for they need to pray for the dead. The mood of this month is one of grave somberness. People would gradually lessen their activities during this time, as if in slumber as well.<br><br>Twelfth Month — Month of Fortune<br><b>Patron Titan</b>: Coin of Whimsy, Zagreus<br>The last month of the year. The previously silent masses would start up their liveliness once more, and good and bad things would start to happen more frequently. Gamblers believe that this month brings them good fortune, and opportunistic merchants look forward to sudden spikes in wealth. Thieves would typically have exhausted their savings, and rub their hands together for the next job. The Month of Fortune is the most tumultuous month for law enforcement.<br><br>Due to Zagreus' unpredictable nature, the number of days in this month can never be confirmed. Sometimes, when you should turn the page at the end of the calendar, a leap day appears at the end of it like a ghost. People call this Month of Fortune with this additional day the \"Scarlet Month,\" and the \"Golden Month\" without. Gamblers and thieves treat this day as their lucky day, becoming fervent with their antics, which is unfortunately followed by plenty of assassinations and conspiracies."

But perhaps at some moment in the future, even this unchanging constant can't escape the winds of change.</i><br><br>The Week and the Days Within<br>Excluding the Month of Fortune, the number of days in each Amphorean month is highly standardized: Every month has four weeks, and every week has seven days, with Sunday being a rest day. Such a custom has been passed down since before the sun faded, and there is a legend of its origin...<br><br>During the Era Creatura, Aquila and Oronyx exerted authority over day and night respectively. However, the night skies of those days were only scattered with clustered stars, hardly a match for the massive celestial body such as the sun. Driven by a competitive streak, Oronyx utilized gems to absorb Aquila's radiance, intertwining it with the satin of the night and shaping a satellite planet that would illuminate the night sky — what everyone knows now as the moon. This undertaking only cost a day's effort.<br><br>Oronyx scrutinized this article, proud of their own creation of perfection. But one meager moon could not rival the brightness the sun offered. And so Oronyx continued to toil away for six sleepless days and nights. For each night that approached, an extra moon would light up the sky. On the sixth day, six shadows accompanied the footsteps of all creatures.<br><br>The presence of the six moons sowed chaos with the tides, incurring Phagousa's scorn. And thus, on the seventh day, with sweet ambrosia incomprehensible to mortals, Phagousa drowned Oronyx in a drunken stupor, causing the latter to sleep the day away. When the night veil fell, the number of moons finally ceased to grow. Phagousa's actions were but a prank on Oronyx, but inadvertently prevented yet another possible war between Aquila and Oronyx.<br><br>However, the existence of six moons did not adhere to balance. Talanton, who had come after catching wind of this, stirred the scale and eliminated two-thirds of the moons, leaving only the red and gold moon, representing the Scarlet Month and Golden Month respectively. When the sun rose on the eighth day, an awoken Oronyx was forbidden from creating any more moons. And that was how the week's cycle was determined. When amending the celestial laws, Kephale designated the seventh day that Oronyx slept through as a rest day.<br><br>Periods of a Day<br>When finalizing the calendar, Kephale divided one day into five major periods, to teach its people to punctually rise, work, rest, and slumber.<br><br>Ever since the scorching sun departed from the sky, the task of illuminating Okhema fell to the Dawn Device — shifts in its light were not obvious to the people in the beginning, and they could only maintain their routines by adhering to the five major periods from before.<br><br><b>Entry Hour</b><br>The time period when various activities gradually begin. People start to rouse from their slumber, summoning their consciousness back to their bodies from distant realms, as if traversing a formless doorway. They fetch water, wash up, and head to the morning market. Those who need something will commit to prayer.<br><br><b>Lucid Hour/Ascent Hour</b><br>The period of the day when one is most awake, thoughts shining into their minds like light piercing glass. People engage in conversation, share teachings and insights and anecdotes, akin to golden threads interwoven with one another. Scholars perform their tasks at twice the speed during this period.<br><br><b>Action Hour/Descent Hour</b><br>The period when enlightenment of the mind starts to wither. People put down their books, exit outdoors for exercise and labor, take care of plants and animals, their perspiration dripping down, seeping into the soil. Scholars and idlers file into the bath in an attempt to invigorate the mind's eye with Phagousa's waters, but the session inevitably ends up in drunken revelry.<br><br><b>Parting Hour</b><br>The period when production activities start to come to rest. People end their day's work at this time, bidding their friends and companions farewell. The army or travelers will usually choose this period to embark on an expedition to minimize disruptions to residential lives.<br><br><b>Curtain-Fall Hour</b><br>People draw their curtains, a period of pillowed rest. A thief star belonging to Zagreus will sail across the sky when this moment ends, punctuating its descent with a long trail, signaling to people that a day has passed. This is also the period when thieves are most active.<br><br><b>About the Thief Star</b>: A characteristically distinctive, but ultimately aimless meteor, its trajectory varying in each appearance. People often see it in the east one moment, then in the west the next. Although the stars of the present have dimmed because of the Dawn Device, the Thief Star remains visible.<br>In extremely rare circumstances, the Thief Star will emanate crimson, heralding the advent of a red moon — this is interpreted as an ominous sign, when plans will go awry, and crushing defeats suffered in battles.<br><br>Quints within Periods<br>People have further divided the five major periods into five sections called \"quints.\" When sections of time need to be explicitly indicated, people will often express said time with a combination of the period and instant, such as \"Curtain-Fall Hour's third quint,\" \"Entry Hour's first quint,\" etc.<br><br>Units of time smaller than quints are rarely used, since people do not need such precise moments of measure. The finer the sections time is cut into, the busier life becomes."

                "Desc": "The Chrysalis of Gold bestowed upon humanity the heart to pursue love, allowing us to passionately listen to those romantic tribulations of the Titans. Among the Titans, Nikador, scorned as the savage god, is highly favored among poets and dramatists. This piece focuses on the brief analysis of the many love stories circulating among folklore — it dissects the complex emotions that humans have on this Titan and Castrum Kremnos.<br><br><i>Nikador and Bepsis</i><br>It is said that Bepsis was born in Mnestia's temple, and personally blessed by the Chrysalis of Gold, giving her golden hair and eyes. Even her nursemaid, who carried her, almost swooned at her sheer beauty. Bepsis's beauty only became even more outstanding as she matured. To stem her endless stream of suitors, Bepsis's tyrant father declared that only those who dueled his three sons and emerged victorious would win her hand. Her three armor-clad brothers were unmatched in the arena — those who came forth to court her were either beaten to a pulp or fled before they even unsheathed their blades.<br><br>Bepsis's beauty also attracted Nikador's attention. They transformed into a young man and boldly issued a challenge to her brothers. The trio, unwitting to the truth, were defeated thoroughly, and had no choice but to betroth her to Nikador. The man arranged for Bepsis to meet at the edge of the highest peak outside the city on the night of the third day, where he would take away his lover. When that night came, Bepsis came to the appointed spot, but only saw a towering giant. Thinking her lover had been slain and fearing her purity ruined by this giant, she leaped off the cliff in a fit of sorrow, thus ending this love that had not even begun.<br><br>Note: Unlike the myths, Bepsis's father and three brothers met their deaths in battle against Castrum Kremnos in real life. Bepsis, refusing to be humiliated after her city was conquered, chose to take her own life in the end. Nikador triumphing over her brothers, revealing their terrifying visage, and forcing the maiden to end her own life are indubitably metaphors in this tale.<br><br>...<br><br><i>Courting Talanton</i><br>While the origin of this story is impossible to verify, it gained popularity from a play called <i>The Weight of Soil</i> in the holy city of Okhema during the Chrysos War. The Scale of Justice, Talanton, was revered by Nikador for their power, and Georios was smitten by them for their fairness. Talanton bade the two suitors seek out the treasure that best represented their love, and in return, would reciprocate the worth in kind.<br><br>The foolish Nikador sought advice from their bosom friend, asking what was equivalent to the love of the Law Titan? Thanatos of the River of Souls told them that only death, which takes away all things fairly, would be truly fair.<br><br>The composed Georios sought advice from Mnestia and Cerces in the forest: How should they respond to Talanton's riddle? Mnestia instigated Georios to give up their own Coreflame, though that would mean the earth would never blossom with vibrant life ever again. Cerces persuaded them to follow their heart, to seek out their most precious treasure.<br><br>And so, Nikador hurled their lance, presenting an obliterated city to Talanton as a gift. Talanton placed their own Coreflame on one side of the scale — if the corpses in the city could balance it out, Nikador would have won their love. Alas, the scale did not budge.<br><br>Georios placed a handful of wheat offered by the humans on the scale. This seemingly shoddy gift pressed the scale down, becoming even heavier than the Coreflame on the Scale of Justice, for it bore with it history and humanity's lives, existence, and future. Finally, because Talanton could not offer more love than this, they were forced to decline Georios's pursuit. However, later poets would often jest that the Scale of Justice prohibited the love in their heart from moving Amphoreus's balance, and that this was just an excuse.<br><br>Note: In this story, the portrayal of the foolish, brutal Nikador clearly vilifies the Titans. The educational and political undertones contained within also indirectly portray war's influence on Okhema's theatrical creativity. Rather than saying people enjoyed making up Nikador's romantic history, one could as well say that they reveled in seeing the failures of the Titan in love. In a certain sense, this reflects the discrimination and animosity the various city-states held for Castrum Kremnos during the Chrysos War."

                "Desc": "(...)<br><br>In Amphoreus, people employ many rituals to honor the world's foundation — the Pillar of Stone, Georios. One of the most important ceremonies is the Georios Mysteries performed annually in the city of Icatus. This ceremony comprises two parts: The Revival Ritual in the {RUBY_B#Fourth Month}Month of Cultivation{RUBY_E#} and the Harvest Ritual in the {RUBY_B#Eighth Month}Month of Reaping{RUBY_E#}.<br><br>Legend has it that, at the beginning of the Era Bellica and following the birth of death, the calamities of aging, sickness, and starvation also swept across the land. Humanity thus began a relentless exploitation of nature with excessive hunting and gathering in order to survive. Enraged by this foolishness, Cerces meted divine punishment and plants began to wither. In their despair, humankind fought one another like wild beasts, robbing each other of whatever precious resources they had. Georios, who deeply loves all creatures on the earth, implored Cerces to give humanity another chance — if humans could overcome their own avarice, life would once again return to the lands.<br><br>Georios bade their kin, the mole, to steal the last apple from humans' bags and to lead humans to a golden wheat field. The masses immediately trampled all over the field in their frenzied efforts to claim as much food as possible. Only a priest of Georios ignored the people's mockery and saved a scoop of wheat seeds, which he planted after offering a prayer to the land. This act placated Cerces' rage, which also allowed humanity to continue their existence.<br><br>People erected a temple to Georios at the place where that handful of wheat seeds were planted, and built the city of Icatus around the temple. During the Month of Reaping, acolytes from all over would deliver their first bundle of harvested wheat to this temple — a token of gratitude to this great Titan.<br><br>It is said that when he buried the wheat seeds, that priest mimicked the act of a mole burrowing into the earth, to loosen up the soil and prepare it for cultivation. This is why families all go to the wild fields to gather a handful of soft dirt at the first moment of {RUBY_B#Dawn}the Entry Hour{RUBY_E#} on the Revival Ritual, which takes place on the eighth day of the Month of Cultivation. After that, they will cleanse that dirt of impurities, place it in a clay container, and enshrine it in their homes — to pray for a bountiful harvest that year.<br><br>After that, with the help of others, the priest would dig up a pre-made clay effigy of Georios buried at an appointed spot. This was meant to symbolize the awakening of the Earth Titan, so that all life could be revived and flourish once more. At the moment of the {RUBY_B#Morning}Lucid Hour{RUBY_E#}, people would gather at the city gate, and the procession would follow behind the dromas pulling the effigy along, all the way to the temple at the heart of the city, where they would perform prayers at the ritual.<br><br>And on the Harvest Ritual, held on the fourth day of the Month of Reaping, Georios disciples and priests from the cities across Amphoreus will gather in Icatus. When {RUBY_B#Noon}the Action Hour{RUBY_E#} reaches its first quint, a grand harvest festival will be held at the temple's plaza, with participants singing, dancing, and feasting. This revelry will continue until {RUBY_B#Evening}the Parting Hour{RUBY_E#} reaches its fifth quint. As the feast comes to a head, the priests will each hold a single ear of wheat, perform their prayers to the statue of Georios in the temple and offer the wheat to the altar. This is to symbolize the lesson of the past that should never be forgotten, as well as to give thanks to Georios' act of asking forgiveness on behalf of humanity from Cerces.<br><br>(...)"

                "Desc": "Rain falls from the sky. It gathers into rivers and flows into the sea. If that is the case, then do the sky-blotting raindrops belong to Aquila's sky or Phagousa's ocean? As one of the most enduring topics in the debates at the forum, this question has yet to have a conclusive answer.<br><br>Regarding the ownership of rain, the theory that we are most familiar with is the primordial theory. Phagousa's priests cite the classics, finding attribution from the creation epics of the Titans' origins. During the Era Luminosa, Aquila and Phagousa spawned from the Pillar of Stone, born of Georios' breath. From that moment on, the ocean and earth have been locked in eternal odds. Phagousa, despised by Georios, could not descend upon the earth. Thus, they wandered between heaven and earth, turning into inextinguishable rain. It wasn't till Talanton's intervention that the brewing pool named Ocean was created on this land. Thus, from the beginning, the rain was a phenomenon that was under Phagousa's realm of governance.<br><br>In response to this argument, scholars of the Grove of Epiphany put forth the Fruit Thesis as a counter-argument. To view the rain as Phagousa's kin was but one perspective — all of Amphoreus' water, from the finest wine in a cup to the rivers in the valley, are all part of the Chalice of Plenty's divine corpus. Even if raindrops would fall from the clouds, it was because they had mistakenly entered Aquila's divine realm in a drunken stupor, and find themselves driven out from the skies by Aquila's enraged, thundering lance.<br><br>With this reasoning, any matter containing water would be part of Phagousa. Ripened fruits also contain tasty juices, therefore the fruits on trees were also part of Phagousa. However, even a three-year-old child from Castrum Kremnos would know that the fruits of the earth are gifts from the Bough of Rift. Thus, the proposition that rain is part of Phagousa is evidently highly contradictory.<br><br>The rain in the sky was a part of Aquila, absorbed by flora, thus becoming the offspring of Cerces. If any body of water is a part of Phagousa, that Titan would even have to take responsibility for the black tide devouring the world.<br><br>Among the many debates, there was no shortage of sophistry. Gordicus, a sage active during the beginning of Era Bellica, once declared in a public debate that rain should be a part of Mnestia's divine being.<br><br>In the rain, people can still see the sky, the earth, and the ocean, but none have seen butterflies fluttering in the rain. When butterflies appear, the rain does not. When rain appears, butterflies vanish without a trace. One could posit that rain and butterflies were two halves of a whole, and that the golden butterfly symbolized Mnestia. The rain equally patters down on all that exists, causing cold and illness in both humans and beasts, but it only nourishes flora — lifeforms protected by Cerces. This inversely also proves that Mnestia, as Cerces' partner, nourishes their lover's body in the form of rain.<br><br>Gordicus' eloquence left many sages at the forum without retort. His destiny also took a turn with this event. After being exiled on successive charges of blasphemy by nine city-states, the proud sage fell by the coast and died in a huge downpour. It is said that returning fishermen saw countless sirens roiling up huge waves, carrying the lifeless Gordicus away with them in the tide. They said that Phagousa was angered by this prideful sage, and turned his soul into a fish, keeping him by their side as a jester for all eternity.<br><br>Since the world still functions normally, the roles of the many Titans governing it must be distinct. However, our wisdom is less than that of even a leaf in a forest — it is only natural that we cannot fathom the truth that constitutes Amphoreus. Only those who acknowledge their own ignorance and approach questions with humility can inch towards Cerces' logic. Gordicus' tale serves as a cautionary reminder for future generations."

This is surely Thanatos' plot of temptation to me, to have me leave this safe harbor, to lure me towards their laughable death.<br><br>But how I long to see the blooms of the meadows one more time. Ask yourself, Mikas — how many years has it been since you smelled the wheat's fragrance in the Month of Cultivation? How many years have you covered your ears, refusing to listen to Phagousa's songs of mirth at their feasts? But I am afraid whenever I hear sounds, afraid that they will see me, then regale Thanatos' ears with my stories.<br><br>(The youth playing the nightingale is wrapped in a black robe, rapping on the stone slab rhythmically)<br><br>And what sound is this?! Who dares tease? Mayhaps one who exposed my scheme to the Hand of Shadows, asking for my death in this very spot? I humbly beseech, please frighten this pathetic king no longer.<br><br>Oh, no! No! Do not knock on that window anymore!<br><br>Act 3<br><i>Chorus</i><br>Mad King Mikas! You leave the looming stone walls, bringing with you your hoarded madness. If foolishness could be brewed into fine wine, then even the Chalice of Plenty would applaud your folly. Alas, you are now foolhardy as a child, uncomprehending the people's mockery, incapable of avoiding the poets' clamor.<br><br>(A silent Mikas walks out of the palace, ten actors pretending to be madmen following behind him)<br><br><i>Attendant</i><br>Brother, could that be our ludicrous king? Why has he blindfolded madmen in tow, as if they are his kin, wordlessly departing his own bastion?<br><br><i>Guard</i><br>Your questions will only be met with my puzzlement. If one could answer, only Thanatos' nightingale knows the truth. If I had to guess, our king could never deceive Thanatos from the start. They only took away half of the king's soul, causing madness, yet never granting true death unto him.<br><br><i>Chorus</i><br>The Immortal King Mikas! You will enter the withered meadows, lost among the gazes of the masses. May you delight in the treasure the Titan bequeathed you, reveling in the prize of immortality among your madness!"

Mix flour and salt in a clay pot, then slowly add olive oil and warm water into it. Use your hands to knead into dough. Cover with a wet cloth, and let it rest for half a day.<br>2. Prepare two types of fillings: One is fresh cloudsheep meat, marinated with vanilla and chopped up prior, then add salt for a bit of seasoning. Next is finely chopped leeks, celery, and dill, which are stirred with a little olive oil.<br>3. Cut the dough into two and flatten each into a circular shape.<br>4. Brush olive oil over a clay baking tray, place one circular dough on it, then spread meat and vegetable filling on each half.<br>5. Place the other circular dough over the first one as a cover, then seal the sides tightly.<br>6. Brush olive oil over the surface, place in a preheated stone kiln, baking for about four quints, till the surface is crisp and golden.<br>7. After taking it out, pour a little honey over the surface.<br><br><i>The double-sided pancake symbolizes Janus's connectivity — one side faces the past, the other ushers in the future.</i><br><i>On the first day of the Month of Gate, family members will gather around the dining table, then the eldest member cuts open the pancake, after which they take turns to taste it. The vegetable filling representing the past is eaten first, to reminisce on memories. Then the meat filling representing the future is eaten, to welcome the new year. After finishing the dish, the youngest member will speak their new year wishes aloud as the representative, to pray to Janus to open the gate to a wonderful future.</i><br><br><br><br>Month of Balance: Scale Soup of the Day of Reflection<br>Ingredients:<br>200g of white beans, 200g of black beans, 200g of lima beans, 200g of Georios roots (cut into small pieces), 200g of tear onions (chopped), 200g of celery (cut into small pieces), 50ml of olive oil, 3 bay leaves, salt to taste, black pepper to taste, 2 liters of rockspring water<br><br>Directions:<br>1. After washing the beans, soak them one day in advance.<br>2. Add olive oil to a large copper pot, then add tear onions when it's heated, then sauté until transparent.<br>3. Add all other ingredients (beans must be drained first), and add water until they are just submerged.<br>4. Boil over a large fire, then reduce to a small fire, add bay leaves, cover the pot and simmer for two hours, until the beans and vegetables are soft and cooked.<br>5. Add salt and black pepper to taste, use a wooden spoon to mash up some of the beans to thicken the soup.<br><br><i>The second month is the Month of Balance that Talanton watches over. Before them, all food ingredients must weigh exactly the same to maintain balance over the scale. During dinner on the Day of Reflection, drinking Scale Soup is a most important ritual to be observed. Before eating, everyone must speak out loud their own reflections of their past actions in unison before partaking in the Scale Soup.</i><br><br>...<br><br><br>\"Pillar Season\"<br><br>Month of Cultivation: Georios' Seven-Grain Bread<br>Ingredients:<br>500g of earthen wheat flour, 500g of cloud wheat flour, 50g of wet oats, 50g of millet, 30g of flax seeds, 30g of sesame seeds, 20g of chia seeds, 15g of yeast, 10g of salt, 30ml of honey, 400ml of Phagousa's warm brew, 30ml of olive oil<br><br>Directions:<br>1. Grind all grains into powder in a stone pestle and mortar, then mix all dry ingredients in a large clay bowl.<br>2. Dissolve the yeast in a little warm water, then add honey and stir well.<br>3. Make a hole in the middle of the flour, pour in the yeast and honey mixture, the remaining water, and olive oil.<br>4. Knead into dough with your hands till a smooth ball is formed, which will take about 1 to 2 quints.<br>5. Cover the dough with linen cloth, then leave it out in a sunny spot for half a day to rise, till it doubles in size.<br>6. Knead into dough again, release the air bubbles, and after shaping it into a ball, score the surface with wheat-ear patterns, then let it rise again for 5 quints.<br>7. Preheat the kiln, use the peel to place the bread in it, and bake for about three quints, till it makes a hollow sound when you tap the bottom.<br><br><i>This is a classic Amphoreus dish: In the Lucid Hour of the Sowing Festival, farmers will gather in the wheat fields, tear the baked seven-grain bread into pieces, and distribute them to everyone on the farm. Everyone will chew on their bread, savoring the seven flavors gifted by Georios.</i><br><i>In the village, farmers still have the tradition of scattering their leftover bread in the fields, a prayer to Georios for a bountiful harvest of the seven grains in the new year. In Okhema and other cities, the residents have modified this custom, tossing their leftover bread into their potted plants instead. Regardless of their practices, the sowing work can only officially commence once this ritual ends.</i><br><br><br><br>Month of Joy: Phagousa's Laughter<br>Ingredients:<br>2 fresh fish (cleaned and sliced into pieces beforehand), 500g of Spiraleye tentacles (cut into pieces), 500g of starshells (cleaned), 2 tear onions (chopped), 4 cloves of garlic (chopped), 100ml of olive oil, 4 wolfpeppers (peeled and chopped), 2 bay leaves, 1 sprig of rosemary, salt and black pepper to taste, 500ml of Phagousa's fine brew 500, 1 liter of rockspring water<br><br>Directions:<br>1. Heat olive oil in a large copper pot, sauté the tear onions and garlic till softened.<br>2. Add wolfpeppers and simmer for 1 quint.<br>3. Add a whole bottle of Phagousa's fine brew, then add bay leaves and rosemary. Cook till the fine brew evaporates.<br>4. Add water, then wait till the broth boils before adding the Spiraleye tentacles, then cook for 1 quint.<br>5. Add fish chunks and starshells, cook over low fire for 2 quints, till the fish is fully cooked and the starshells have opened.<br>6. Add salt and black pepper to taste, then serve.<br><br><i>During the revelry in the Month of Joy, many in Okhema will gather in the city's public spaces and stew this giant pot of fish soup together. When the soup is done, remember to pour the first spoon of the soup onto the ground as thanks to Phagousa. When the appreciation ritual is completed, you can enjoy the fish soup.</i><br><i>During this time, remember to blow hard on the surface of the fish soup, to ideally imitate the sound of laughter. It is said if Phagousa hears enough merriment, they will infiltrate the crowd and bask in the feast with everyone else, bestowing their mysterious graces upon all present.</i><br><br>..."

Perhaps it is this reason that led people to believe that they would receive Cerces' guarded secrets if they also ate the Leaves of Wisdom.</i><br><i>What is interesting is that the Grove would stash bitter herbs randomly among the leaves. According to scholars who had the honor of attending, this was because the bitterness would stimulate the taste buds — the scholars saw this act as an opportunity to spur thought and growth.</i><br><br>...<br><br><br><br>\"Calamity Season\"<br><br>Month of Strife: Nikador's Shield of Victory<br>Ingredients:<br>500g of red wheat flour, 15g of yeast, 10g of salt, 300ml of warm water, 50ml of olive oil, 100ml of Nikador's ambrosia, 100g of Nikador Fruits, 100g of walnuts (slightly chopped), 2 sprigs of rosemary (remove leaves and chop those up)<br><br>Directions:<br>1.

Press on the dough surface with a shield-shaped stamp, or shape it into a shield by hand, then let it rest and rise for 30 minutes.<br>8. Preheat the kiln, place the dough in it and let bake for about 75 minutes till the surface is a deep red. Ideally, it should make a hollow sound when you tap its bottom.<br><br><i>This is a specialty of Castrum Kremnos. Its making is said to commemorate the heroes who died in war.</i><br><i>The bread's deep red crust symbolizes the sacrifices in war, and the nuts and vanilla inside symbolize tenacious spirits and honor. Nikador's disciples use this shield-shaped bread to pay tribute to this Titan and to inspire the fighting will of their troops.</i><br><br><br><br>Month of Mourning: Thanatos' Requiem Pudding<br>Ingredients:<br>500ml of cloudsheep milk, 100g of rice, 50ml of honey nectar blessed by Mnestia, 1 stick of cinnamon, lemon peels (1 lemon's worth), a little rock salt, 50g of almonds (chopped)<br><br>Directions:<br>1. Wash the rice and soak it for 15 minutes.<br>2. Pour cloudsheep milk into a copper pot, then add cinnamon, lemon peels, and a little salt.

Add chopped almonds, then stir lightly.<br>6. Pour the mixture into a clay bowl and let it rest till room temperature. Then place it in the ice casket and chill for at least 30 minutes till it is completely congealed. (When the outdoor temperature is lower, you can place the clay bowl in a ventilated area outside).<br>7. Before eating, sprinkle a few Nikador Fruits as garnish.<br><br><i>This pudding is pure white. During the nights of the Month of Mourning, many families will raise a miniature Thanatos altar, then gather around it and offer the pudding. They take turns speaking of memories shared with the deceased, then they can eat the pudding.</i><br><i>Legend has it that the more emotional the memory, the easier it is to earn Thanatos' blessing — The Titan will soothe the spirit of the departed and helps the living find closure. Remember to leave a serving of pudding for Thanatos when the ritual has ended to give thanks to them.</i><br><br><br><br>Month of Fortune: Spirit Day's Lucky Cookies<br><br>Ingredients:<br>Mix 300g of wheat flour and 100g of butter (softened at room temperature), 100g of sugar, 1 Dollo egg, 5ml of vanilla extract, a little rock salt, 100g of various dried fruits (such as dried figs, apricots, raisins etc., must be chopped), 100g of various nuts (such as walnuts, chestnuts, etc., must be chopped)<br><br>Special Tools:<br>Paper strips made from cloudsheep hide (written with various fortunes, some good, some bad)<br>1 Zagreus' Silver Coin (must be cleaned beforehand)<br><br>Directions:<br>1.

                "Desc": "<b>Origin</b><br>Many may know that the Thief's Hand is the avatar of Zagreus, the Trickery Titan... or at least it was. But mortals like us will never fathom the machinations of the Titans — Why do they have to make a hand every time it manifests? Why do they leave the hand behind every time they depart? And what does the hand's final gesture, with its middle finger raised, mean? Perhaps only Cerces has the answer to these questions.<br><br>But compared to that slippery Titan, these stone mounds are much more stable — they don't roll around in foul mire, nor do they sow chaos for sheer pleasure. Also, sheesh, these things used to fly in the sky, causing the earliest Georios craftsmen to laud its \"potential\" as soon as they laid eyes on it. After an arduous process of soul reforging and intent transference, this Thief's Hand was crafted.<br><br>The only serious issue was that the stone control panel was so heavy. It could only be processed in the city and then had to be transported out upon completion. What else can we do? We had to spend thousands of Balance Coins to rent a dromas just to transport it. And when we got there, those lumbering lug nuts couldn't even fit through the ruins' gate. We get kicked by them if we try to force them through the gate. As the one in charge, I had to unload the goods and personally pull and drag them inside. My poor back was creaking from all that work. Please don't let it summon Thanatos. Bah, I digress.<br><br><b>Operation</b><br>If you are reading this operational stone slab, it means you must be a hero among heroes. If it was some other ordinary person, even if they memorized the procedure like the back of their hand, getting this up and running may still have been a tough feat. But even if you're an exemplar, you'd still need to memorize the following instructions well, or between the Thief's Hand and yourself, one of you would surely end up damaged.<br><br>There are two parts to this operational stone platform. The first is the platform itself — there are several bumps on the surface, and they all can be pressed down. Their respective functions are forward, backward, and... other very intricate functions. They'll be introduced in the upcoming chapters.<br><br>The other part is this ball. Usually embedded in the platform, it will hover when activated. When you are using it, place it in your hand and hold it like you would an egg, then rotate it, and the Thief's Hand will follow suit.<br><br>Sounds simple, yeah? But you can't just focus on the stone platform. You have to keep your eyes on the Thief's Hand. You'll know how hard it is once you use it, especially if you're too used to using photostones in the city. Letting someone like that mess about with the controls is no different from scattering a swathe of dirt across the platform — a dromas dragging its tongue across the controls will do better than them.<br><br>There was someone who confidently thought they had the chops and wanted to give it a try. The result? As expected, it was like that person had some grudge against the west, knocking down six walls in that direction with the hand, and almost broke the hand. It was such a mess that even Zagreus would have second-hand embarrassment. And they didn't even want to admit they sucked, either. They kept saying the controls were designed badly and not meant for humans.<br><br>Nonsense. That hand was made by a Titan — if it wasn't for Georios' craftsmen, ordinary mortals wouldn't even be able to lay a finger on this divine relic.<br><br>I'm warning you again: Be extremely careful when controlling it. If you trash a hand, then we lose one hand forever. No one alive can make them anymore.<br><br><b>Troubleshooting</b><br>Sometimes it doesn't obey commands and flies everywhere., even if you've made sure that you haven't been drinking ambrosia and that Thanatos hasn't set their sights on you. Don't worry. This problem is inherent with these hands. Even the craftsmen can't explain it.<br><br>There's probably nothing we can do to fix it, either. It was made by Zagreus, after all.<br><br>You can try the following solutions:<br>1. Just wait for it to let out whatever it's got pented up and settle down.<br>2. Grab something hard, cut the hand with it, then pour golden blood into the hand. Give it a few hours, and the hand should be as dexterous as new.<br><b>Additional note: I mean cut the Thief's Hand, not your own hand.</b><br><br><b>Appendix</b><br>All right, that's the end of the beginner's chapter, but it'll only be enough to teach you the very basics of the Hand's controls. You'll need to thoroughly review the entire manual several times over before you start operating it for real, though.<br><br>You must be thinking that you've understood nothing at all so far and that you should just read the second half of the manual ASAP.<br><br>That won't do. By Janus, that's the whole point of being a \"beginner\" — taking things one step at a time.<br><br>But I get your frustration — you want some consolation, don't you? Take a look at this then.<br><br><i>The Advanced Chapter's discount code: Hygilos is as cunning as Zagreus.</i>"

In this world shrouded by eternal night, though we may no longer lay eyes on the starry sky, Janusopolis' astrology arts passed down to us remains the bridge that connects us to the Titans' will.<br><br>Remember, true astrology is not mere inference of the celestial bodies, but insight into the laws of how the world works, and perceiving the signs that the Titans left behind.<br><br><i>*A line of crooked characters — from the ink's color, it appears to have been added in recent years: *</i><br><i>!!! Even in the Eternal City of Okhema, beneath the radiant shine of the Dawn Device, and even if we will never witness the eternal night of Oronyx — we can still glimpse the trail of destiny through calculation and extrapolation!!!</i><br><br>Chapter 1: Twelve Palaces and Titans<br>Before learning about astrology, you must familiarize yourself with the Twelve Palaces and their respective Titans:<br>1. Dawn Palace — Aquila<br>2. Earth Palace — Georios<br>3. Tide Palace — Phagousa<br>4. Erudite Palace — Cerces<br>5. Omniscience Palace — Kephale<br>6. War Palace — Nikador<br>7. Evernight Palace — Oronyx<br>8. Justice Palace — Talanton<br>9. Passage Palace — Janus<br>10. Aunarch Palace — Mnestia<br>11. Trickery Palace — Zagreus<br>12. Death Palace — Thanatos<br>Each Palace represents a specific Titan's authority, influencing different facets of the world. When we divine, we must calculate the positions and strengths of each Palace in the sky to forecast how the Titan's will manifests.<br><br>Chapter 2: Astrology Calculation<br>I know that most of our readers would hail from the Eternal City of Okhema — it is currently enveloped in the radiance of the Dawn Device and unable to directly observe the starry skies. Nonetheless, this does not mean that the art of astrology has lost its meaning. On the contrary, the Dawn Device's operational principles have provided us with a new foundation of calculation.<br><br>To perform astrology forecasts, we must first observe the Dawn Device's changes in light. Note down the brightest and dimmest moments within a day, for these two times indicate the changes in Aquila's authority. With these as fundamental references, we can forecast the positions of the other Palaces.<br><br>For example, when the Dawn Device is at its brightest, the Dawn Palace's position is directly above.<br>At that moment, the Earth Palace would be positioned east, Tide Palace would be west, Evernight Palace would be directly below, and the other Palaces would be positioned in clockwise order.<br><br><i>*An anonymous note written to the side: *</i><br><i>The Dawn Device's light changes in intensity...? I can't tell at all. Also, is this even considered astrology anymore?</i><br><i>You can't take any of this book's contents too seriously. Don't be misled by those devious disciples of Oronyx!!!</i><br><br>Chapter 3: Chart Mapping<br>After ascertaining the heavenly Palaces' positions, the next step is to draw the chart. The chart is a circular diagram divided into twelve equal sections, each section representing a Palace.<br><br>Mapping steps are as follows:<br>1. Draw a big circle representing the entire world.<br>2. Divide this circle into twelve equal sections.<br>3. Within each section, mark the corresponding Palace names and their Titan's title.<br>4. Determine, according to the Dawn Device's changes in light, the exact positions of each Palaces.<br>5. Draw a smaller circle at the center of the big circle, representing the divined individual.<br><br>Remember, the chart is not fixed, nor unchanging. With the passage of time, the positions of each Palace will also change. This is why the precise recording of time is essential.<br><br>Chapter 4: Interpreting the Titans' Influence<br>Once the mapping of the chart is complete, you can start to interpret the Titans' influence on us. Influence is largely dependent on two factors: The Palaces' positions and the aspect relations between Palaces.<br><br>[Positional Influence]<br>The influence of the Palace in the east is strongest, symbolizing new life and ascendance.<br>The Palace directly above represents the state of apex.<br>The influence of the Palace in the west is weaker, representing decline.<br>The influence of the Palace directly below is weakest, yet also hints at the possibility of concealment and rebirth.<br><br>[Aspect Relations]<br>Opposition: Two Palaces that are 180 degrees apart represent conflict and opposition.<br>Trine: 120 degrees apart, representing harmony and complementarity.<br>Square: 90 degrees, representing anxiety and challenge.<br>Sextile: 60 degrees apart, representing opportunity and potential.<br><br>For example, if the Erudite Palace and War Palace form an opposition, it can be construed as a clash between reason and violence. And if the Erudite Palace and Omniscience Palace form a trine, it may mean that the powers of knowledge and omniscience are harmonized — a grand opportunity to perform study and discovery.<br><br>Chapter 5: Practice and Caution<br>As a beginner, you can start with simple everyday divinations. For example, performing a reading at the Entry Hour every day to forecast the general flow of the day. Then, during the Curtain-Fall Hour, review your astrological notes for the day to see if your results match the readings of the day's Entry Hour. As you garner more experience, you can try to decipher more complicated aspects.<br><br>However, keep in mind that while astrology is powerful, it is not omnipotent. The will of the Titans is unfathomable, and our readings will forever be mere conjecture and observations. Pray be always humble, and never seek to challenge the Titans' authority.<br><br>Additionally, be on guard against charlatans who proclaim themselves total masters of destiny. True astrologers know that our duty is to interpret destiny, not to manipulate it.<br><br>Last but not least, may Oronyx's wisdom guide you.<br><br>..."

As more and more fruits piled up, someone would inevitably be unable to eat them all. However, the monkeys showed no concern, smiling as they insisted to each passenger, \"Be sure to finish them, or something terrible will happen.\"<br><br>But how could anyone possibly finish such an ever-increasing number of fruits? In the end, my friend saw the consequences faced by a fellow traveler who failed to eat the fruits.<br>You might think I'm about to recount gory details in a gruesome manner... But what happened was even eerier and more horrific.<br><br>They're just using every method they can to force their victim to eat all the fruits.

These academic achievements seem unrelated, but they have brought Bohdan, Lambda, and me together in the Energy Research Lab. After so many years, we are now doing research under the same roof once again, and Lambda seems very happy.<br><br>Regarding our membership in the Genius Society, truth be told, the three of us haven't attached too much significance to it. From my student days, it was clear to me that \"genius\" was merely a broad term for exceptional brilliance. Different geniuses excel in various fields. The feats achieved by the geniuses Harald Punch, Nyul Iman, and someone named <b>Polka Kakamond</b> are beyond my wildest dreams. However, they can never replicate what I have done, either.<br><br>However, I can't care less about the other members of the Genius Society, as they are too far away from us. The dynamics among us three classmates concern me more at present.<br><br><i>███ 05</i><br>I gifted Lambda a set of exoskeleton. Unknown to her, I discreetly implanted a 98% pure Grayseal Gold pellet in the structure of its <u>ring finger</u>, cleverly disguising it as a ring... No, this is my secret not meant for sharing, and if she discovers it later, I'll simply attribute it to a <b>coincidence</b> while crafting the exoskeleton.<br><br><i>Oct ██</i><br>During our polar expedition yesterday, Lambda finally successfully located the underground energy source she had long pursued using bio-waves. This discovery could power all the cities on planet Ohioti for half a century. Her elation was palpable — she even kicked off her shoes. Then, Bohdan told me they divorced again. This is their fourth re-marriage and divorce. I was unsure how to react... <b>Coincidentally</b>, a butterfly fluttered in the wilderness, lingering before my eyes for quite a while. I don't know why, but that butterfly resembles me in some inexplicable manner. It was the first time I realized such creatures existed in the polar regions of planet Ohioti.<br><br><i>███ ██</i><br>No, something is definitely off. If she hadn't gone there, Bohdan would have been there, and it would have been him who got killed in the explosion, but instead, I sent him to the hospital. Furthermore, why did ██████████ and all the █████ were closed, and she <u>happened to █████</u>? Is this a mere <b>coincidence</b>? Or perhaps...?<br><br><i>███ ██</i><br>I've found the camera Lambda had hidden in Bohdan's lab. God knows why she would need that surveillance, but that's not important. The surveillance record shows that the Grayseal Gold I had discreetly placed in the Phlogiston observation device didn't work as I had planned. In other words, Bohdan wasn't wounded because of my plan, but the Phlogiston leakage aligned perfectly with my expectations. This can't be a mere <b>coincidence</b>. <u>Someone else has been moving my plan forward.</u><br><br><i>███ 15</i><br>Lambda smashed that exoskeleton along with the Grayseal Gold pellet. Technically, an ordinary hammer wouldn't have reacted with the Grayseal Gold, but the incident in the central control room couldn't be a mere <b>coincidence</b>.<br><br>Who gave Lambda that special hammer? And why would she smash the exoskeleton at that precise moment? It simply doesn't make sense.<br><br><i>███ █4</i><br><b>Polka Kakamond</b> is still alive? I thought that Genius had passed away... This discovery has given me some insights."

                "Desc": "* Confidential Warning: This document contains highly confidential information on Penacony. Unauthorized distribution will result in severe consequences.<br><br><b>I. Incident Background</b><br>During the second quarter of the first year of AE 2158, a memetic virus known as the \"Slumbernana Monkey\" spread rapidly in the Dreamscape through images, sounds, and videos. Its impact escalated within the entire Dreamscape and fully covered it in about a week, with its distribution on online platforms manually restricted to evade the IPC's regulation on information.<br><br>Some affected individuals gradually exhibited symptoms such as hallucinations, delirium, and aphasia. Some severely impacted victims even shifted their intra-cognition to Slumbernana Monkeys, directly influencing their mental state in reality.<br><br>During this period, dream nurses provided care to affected individuals by focusing on emotion regulation and memory erasure. However, they merely classified the cause of the illness as a common cognitive dissonance symptom, stating, \"They're really caught up in their memes,\" without highlighting any potential risks.<br><br><b>II. Incident Details</b><br>Penacony's Paperfold University was carrying out the Dreamlight Anniversary in the Moment of Sol. All faculty members went to Sunshine Park to conduct academic seminars. During their absence, the Sweet Dreams Troupe specially customized by the Iris Family temporarily took over the teaching and management tasks.<br><br>Being memetic beings with cognitive abilities, the Sweet Dreams Troupe was also directly affected by the memetic virus and started spreading the virus through teaching, severely infecting a large number of students. Soon, the students who were infected and saw themselves as Slumbernana Monkeys disappeared from the school, presumably transported to other regions of the Dreamscape by the suspect.<br><br>After the incident lasted a day, the Nameless, who came to participate in the anniversary, and an illegally trespassing Galaxy Ranger intervened, destroying the memetic core of the memetic virus and returning the missing students to campus. However, they refused to provide further information. As a result, the only thing that we know is that the suspect is a member of AtaviSearch Forest, a criminal organization related to Dr. Primitive.<br><br>According to statements from stowaways recently arrested by the Bloodhound Family, their fleet had encountered \"a very, very, very big banana floating in the universe\" at the edge of Asdana. If it was not a hallucination caused by memoria allergy, it would most likely have been the ship of the suspect.<br><br>During the accident, the Bloodhound security guards outside the campus failed to provide any relevant information. After the incident, no relevant information was extracted from their memories, and all the infected students also lost their memories during the infection. This memory loss is currently determined to be unrelated to the memetic virus, and the exact cause is still under investigation.<br><br><b>III. Losses</b><br>Per <i>Penaconian Public Accident Economic Loss Standards</i>, the direct economic loss totaled 11,943,000 Alfalfa credits, mainly for compensating affected merchants selling Slumbernana-Monkey-related merchandises and for follow-up virus elimination.<br><br><b>IV. Causes</b><br><b>(1) Main Cause:</b><br>The large-scale criminal organization AtaviSearch Forest specifically produced the memetic virus Slumbernana Monkey against Penacony and released the virus here. The personnel of the relevant departments failed to identify the risks and take effective measures in a timely manner, resulting in the outbreak of the memetic virus.<br><br><b>(2) Additional Factors:</b><br>① The security department within the Bloodhound Family and its affiliated departments lack a comprehensive security system at dreamers' cognitive level and do not possess the technology to thoroughly screen all information entering the Dreamscape.<br><br>② Dream nursing department in the Iris Family lack security awareness and fail to report relevant risks promptly. The Iris Family's Sweet Dreams Troupe system was breached by the suspect and thus lacked security.<br><br>③ The Family branches in Penacony failed to promptly take up the responsibilities originally shouldered by the Oak Family, resulting in poor flexibility in some decision-making processes and a deficiency in risk response capabilities.<br><br>④ The whereabouts of the suspect and the memetic virus have not been identified so far, potentially indicating surveillance blind spots within the Dreamscape."

The Glaux Cup), with no violations identified.<br><br>2. Following thorough investigations, no evidence substantiating the existence of Innasemboat has been found by the university. Further exploration revealed that the concept was first mentioned in an article titled <i>Sixteen Family Heads Identified as Innasemboat Members: Unveiling the Enigmatic Club's Purpose</i> in the magazine <i>Penacony Unsolved Mysteries</i>, Vol 23. This magazine is known for continuously spreading misinformation extensively, and the Student Court is of the mind to view the Innasemboat theory as a groundless conspiracy theory.<br><br>Approximately ██ years ago, Dean Glaux introduced the Spheroid Race to the university to promote inter-academy communication and friendship and enable students to chase after excellence via competitive sports. Over the years, the Spheroid Race Committee has remained dedicated to Dean Glaux's vision, ensuring that the tournament upholds fairness without favoritism toward any student, academy, or organization. With hundreds of tournaments held to date, the Glaux Cup retains its prestige as the apex of collegiate Spheroid competition, which stands as proof of its universally recognized equitable nature by both students and faculty on campus.<br><br>Additionally, cooperation between academies has been a common practice throughout the history of the Spheroid Race, aligning with Dean Glaux's original intentions for the event. While we advocate for students to remain vigilant against unfair practices, we call upon all to show respect for all participants who exemplify the spirit of sportsmanship.<br><br><br>Magistrate Irena, Student Affairs Court<br>The Paperfold University Student Court reserves the right for the final interpretation in rendering judgments.<br><br>"

Please thoroughly investigate Prema and the enigmatic force of Pepeshi known as Innasemboat behind her.<br><br><b>Petition Details:</b><br><br>Dear Paperfold University Student Court,<br><br>Paperfold University is facing an unprecedented crisis!!! I've alerted the Student Court about this severity of this issue 57 times, but I haven't received any replies so far. Still, I won't give up! Today, I'm resubmitting my petition to fully disclose all the details, even though this may place me at great risk...<br><br>During Paperfold University's 550th Spheroid Race Qualifier last month, Prema, a sophomore Pepeshi at Charmony Academy, was chosen as the Paperfold University Top Driver and represented Charmony Academy for the upcoming university Spheroid Race this year. While many naive students celebrated having the first Pepeshi driver in the university, they were unaware that Prema's selection was influenced by an organization called \"Innasemboat,\" <br>a secretive group composed of Pepeshi.<br><br>Yes, you heard me right. The seemingly unassuming Pepeshi have banded together through Innasemboat, exerting covert influence over various aspects of Penacony's society, including the economy, politics, healthcare, education, and beyond. Allow me to briefly introduce Innasemboat. It is an ancient elite society of Pepeshi, with origins dating back to before the establishment of Paperfold University. This organization operates with a strict hierarchical structure where seniority equates to rank, where seats are passed down in families to ensure the preservation of wealth and power via blood. The organization continuously enlists top elites from Penacony's political and commercial circles as executors of the leader's will, which explains why Pepeshi seldom hold prominent positions openly in society.<br><br>The Prema Incident exposes their next move: Innasemboat aims to infiltrate the sports and entertainment sectors of Penacony to enhance their reputation, gain public favor, and lay the groundwork for their control of darkness. I'm hereby presenting substantial evidence that the Prema Incident is part of their elaborate scheme:<br><br>1. Pepeshi drivers have never appeared in the Spheroid Race's 500-year history, so how did they suddenly have a star driver after 500 years of incompetence? Someone must be behind this.<br>2. Prema has repeatedly received assistance from racing champions of rival academies (such as Romeo, the former champion of Fortune Academy). Such an act of betraying his academy and aiding his competitor suggests either ulterior motives or external coercion on Romeo's side.<br>3. Lastly, a most subtle yet most significant detail: Prema's Spheroid is named \"The Flying Pepeshi,\" reminiscent of a ghost ship from the movie <i>Asdana Pirates</i>. Why would a Spheroid be named after a ship? Think about the name \"Innasemboat\" and you'll figure out why!<br><br>The average students lack insight. They have never connected these three elements and thus fail to grasp the bigger picture. However, as I add in the missing link named Innasemboat, everything should become crystal clear to all. Lastly, I will present this astonishing fact: Why has the Innasemboat's conspiracy never been exposed through the years? Because the Pepeshi have controlled the entire Penaconian media industry. The fact that the news host Uma is a Pepeshi serves as the most direct evidence.<br><br>Given its implications for fair competition and potential security risks for the campus, I, on behalf of all students, hereby present the following demands to the Paperfold University Council and the Student Court:<br><br>1. Conduct a comprehensive investigation and eradicate the influence of Innasemboat from the university.<br>2. Implement rigorous examinations upon all current and future Pepeshi students within the university.<br>3. Disclose the investigation results to all students and announce a personal apology to me.<br><br><br>Should the Student Court once again reject my petition, it would be reasonable for me to suspect that Innasemboat has infiltrated the Student Court. In such a scenario, I will escalate this matter beyond the Student Court and report directly to the University Council.<br><br><br>It is everyone's responsibility to safeguard Paperfold University!<br>An ordinary student deeply devoted to Paperfold University,<br>Hertz"

However, it is no exaggeration to say that everyone can be called an artist during times such as those.<br><br>Think about it...<br><br>An environment where artworks can be made manifest by the power of thought alone.<br>The intimidation between gangs and factions tends to favor the most eye-catching expressions.<br>Explorers of dreams must leave behind blatant and comprehensible signals of danger for those who could not use Synesthesia Beacons.<br>Members of the public use symbols and images to mark their personal effects.<br>...<br><br>People often express their desires through personal style, splashing the costless and vivid memoria paint across every corner of the dreamscape, with little regard for whether the canvas belongs to someone else or had another intended purpose.<br>On certain smooth and expansive \"canvases\" of high quality, dozens of overlapping designs from different hands can be found, creating a strange, yet captivating mosaic of memes.<br><br>Later, during the early days of Penacony's birth, when the act of \"art\" had just begun to take root in the dreamscape, the images that surfaced in people's minds were still those ubiquitous patterns — Graffiti prototypes that are now called Primordial Dreamscape art.<br><br>...<br><br><b>Chapter 12: Dreamscape and Hallucisomnism</b><br>Since its inception, the film industry has been the primary entertainment industry in Penacony, deeply familiar to every resident.<br>This led many wildly creative Dreamweavers and filmmakers to reflect during their downtime:<br><i>\"We're already in a dream, do we still have to watch 2D films in a cinema?\"</i><br>Inspired by this thought, some artists, leveraging their understanding of memoria, began exploring new forms of expression unique to the Dreamscape.<br>Thus, the movement of Hallucisomnism was born. It emerged from Dreamweavers' experiments and, over the span of an Amber Era, permeated various fields of art.<br><br><b>Dream's Eye Art</b><br>Initially, it was merely a tool for Dreamweavers to move swiftly while working. However, after numerous Dreamchasers expressed awe and admiration for the experience, artists began designing works of art based on Dream's Eye. These ranged from massive flat murals to three-dimensional sculptures made from various objects.<br>Despite becoming a brief sensation, as the public began to understand its nature, most grew bored with this form of creation, accustomed as they were to the marvels of the Dreamscape. Coupled with the high difficulty of creation and the expensive cost of setting up Dream's Eyes, this artistic style remained niche.<br>Even so, a loyal group of enthusiasts regularly visits the Dream's Edge, just to witness these wonders.<br><br><b>Exaggerated Dreamcore</b><br>Impressions of the Dreamscape can be abstracted into common representations, which, when translated into art, are known as \"Dreamcore.\"<br>Since we already reside within a dream... this allows creators to be far more daring in their concepts.<br><b><i>The Summer Seaside Mansion and the Monocular</i> by Author Unknown, Dreamscape Construct, Moment of Oasis</b><br><i>The centerpiece of this work is a Salsottoan monocular, magnified a million times, forming the entrance to the seaside mansion. The interior structure consists entirely of pure white, threshold-defying spaces filled with swimming pools.</i><br><br>Creations similar to this are restricted by The Family due to their high memoria usage and have gradually faded out of the creators' radar.<br><br><b>Illusion Art</b><br>Technically, similar styles exist in other worlds, where the core lies in provoking the viewer's illusion — distorting their sense of space, using color tricks, etc. However, in the Dreamscape, dreamweaving technology can greatly enhance these experiences, making the illusions extend beyond just visual perception.<br>At the time, creators believed this style was the most fitting for the Dreamscape. \"Dreams should be a bit erratic,\" they said.<br>Notable works include:<br><b><i>The True Lilac Chaser</i> by Author Unknown, Architecture, preserved in the Blue Hour</b><br><b><i>You Think You're Outside the Wardrobe?</i> by Author Unknown, SoulGlad Bottle Painting, creation date unknown, currently sealed by the Bloodhound Family</b><br>Since the Fourth Charmony Festival, similar creations have been restricted due to their tendency to trigger memetic incidents.<br><br>In conclusion, all exploratory attempts born of the Hallucisomnism Era have failed for various reasons. However, the process has been deemed \"artful enough,\" or \"Penaconian enough.\"<br>As the sole technology currently unanimously recognized as excellent, the art of dream bubble films has been preserved to this day. Its craftsmanship meant its progress has been permanently stalled in Penacony, but it is because of this echo that countless memories are attracted and eventually come streaming, Penacony-bound.<br><br>...<br><br><b>Chapter 32: The Effects of Paths on Creation</b><br>Pulling the perspective back by an Era to the time when Penacony's sounds of Harmony gradually became clearer, the dissonant sounds in contrast began to fade away.<br><br>The founder of the well-known Paperfold University and head of the Nightingale Family at the time, Glaux, ultimately chose a more gentle approach to express his concerns regarding The Family's future and the Path of Harmony they followed.<br><br><b><i>Sixteen Art Pieces</i> by Glaux, Memoria Artwork, currently conserved in the Paperfold University Museum</b><br><i>The central image features sixteen painters, each dressed in distinct attire, with their heads exaggerated into the shape of musical notes.

Students are keen on chasing the next best thing, and this is sure to be completely abandoned.

As we understand, all members of the literature club have received professional recitation training and have experience in performing at music parties.<br>If your writing is particularly terrible, your work will be printed as a manuscript and the members will eat it.

The accident caused one party (the driver) to be shocked awake and damage to their vehicle, but the Intellitron tourist was not visibly damaged aside from damage to their clothing. Fragments of the vehicle became fused to the Intellitron tourists' memoria-simulated magnetic mechanical body, which led to a persistent phantom feeling after leaving the dream. In the end, they were successfully separated by a \"cognitive surgery\" in the Dreamscape.<br><br>Interview with the accident supervisor:<br><i>\"...Well, of course, it became very loud. The Utopon is public property, after all... You didn't see how funny it was though. It was like a person had grown trumpet out of their body! Hahaha!<br>...Uh, you've already started recording, right? Uhh, I'll leave the jokes aside for now then. The Intellitron tourist's body was extremely solid and robust, so it was almost impossible for them to suffer external damage. So, if a similar accident were to occur again, make sure to prioritize the safety of guests of other races first... No-no-no! I wasn't discriminating against inorganic beings! Can we just stick to the facts for a minute?<br>If tourists require mental health services, please communicate with an Iris Family contact...\"</i><br><br>...<br><br><b>Case 18</b><br>When using a Bubble Pinball to move between areas, a Dreamchaser was prematurely launched before the fender reached the set position due to a technical malfunction, causing the projectile vehicle to rebound twice and crash into a crowd of people. Five people were immediately shocked awake and fourteen people from the surrounding areas suffered varying degrees of shock. The Dreamchaser involved was confirmed to be in a state of shock, but was later discovered multiple times attempting to use the Bubble Pinball machine to recreate the above situation.<br><br>Interview with the accident supervisor:<br><i>\"...As for this one (the victim), there's an 80% chance they'll be out of their minds for a few months. As for what actually happened to them after that, I have no idea.<br>What's more, our (pin) ball machines don't tend to malfunction like this. We handed this over to those responsible for the equipment and they found that... There was external tampering and we reported it to the Bloodhound Family to investigate. They never found the culprit.<br>So, we... You know... We declared to the public that this was the work of the Masked Fools... That's right. They won't argue with that!<br>So, we concluded through this incident that... those in charge of each Moment should periodically inspect to see if their (pin) ball machine's braking systems are functioning normally.\"</i><br><br>...<br><br><b>Case 63</b><br>A tourist was reported missing. Someone familiar with the missing person reported that they drove out in a Steinway Falcon, attempting to drive directly from the Moment of Dusk to the Moment of Daybreak. After the incident, the Oak Family immediately began a search, but to no avail. The hotel in the real world was also unable to contact the tourist in question.<br>After a few days, the vehicle in question was discovered in a dream crevice, completely empty. Following clues at the scene, the Family's public relations team immediately intervened and covered up all information on the accident.<br>A number of years after the incident, this tourist was discovered in ███, and they were also ████████████████████.<br><br>Interview with the accident supervisor:<br><i>\"...We sincerely advise that we include in the dreamscape guide that the only officially recognized method to move between Moments is being transported via the Hotel. This is extremely important.<br>Furthermore, we ask all lineage members that, after learning of a client's intention to attempt travel to other Moments via other methods, to convince them otherwise. Of course, if this is not possible, then forget it.<br>Also, we once believed this incident to be entirely fictitious. We also ask all lineage members to unify their cognition on this point: ███ does not exist in the Dreamscape!\"</i><br><br>...<br><br><b>Case 114</b><br>A series of vehicles were thrown into a pile-up when a customized \"Beyond Overcooked\" suddenly charged into the center of the ring road surrounding Paperfold University. One person was shocked awake and many vehicles were damaged. The total direct property damage exceeded one billion Alfalfa credits. Investigation showed that this accident was deliberately created. The \"Beyond Overcooked\" that caused the accident was owned by an individual. It is suspected that this was caused by a dispute between students. The fallout of this incident was enormous.<br><br>Interview with the accident supervisor:<br><i>\"...An incident like this cannot be allowed to occur again. I am aware that this incident even brought a wave of creative inspiration to the campus, but if such events occur in Penacony again, it's all over!<br>Those students are the stars of tomorrow! Plus, if their parents were to come in and cause a fuss, I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Oti Alfalfa fired us all on the spot!<br>Whatever happens, we have to let the school be aware of our recommendations and increase security inspections on campus. We can't let them just keep bringing whatever they want into the school. The security keeps confiscating five or six Memory Zone Memes a week...<br>...What do you mean they're too busy eating bananas to deal with this!?\"</i>"

Please explain further motivation for this revision.<br>- Mr. Dungeon drank seventeen bottles of SoulGlad in a row during a vocal music class and was reported by students. The reason for the report was that they wanted to drink SoulGlad too. However, what the students did not know was that Mr. Dungeon had no choice but to do this to maintain his body temperature and replenish his stamina. Not to mention that Mr. Dungeon's stomach issues were originally caused by the infuriation he suffers from teaching that class.<br>- Though the academy does not encourage this behavior, considering the obviously outstanding teaching skills of Mr. Dungeon, this will be approved temporarily with a probationary period.</i><br><br>(New addition) Students are prohibited from using the personal property of the faculty in the name of study.<br><i>- Does this article need to be explicitly listed? What's more, if it really is for the purpose of study and education, is it not normal for us to be a little more lenient?<br>- Last year, those Dreamweaver Academy troublemakers took my car apart in the middle of the night, moved the parts into my office, and then reassembled it in there! They threatened me and said that if I didn't give them a good grade, they would not help me move it. The car was wider than the door frame, so there was no way for me to drive it out! I had to walk to work for two months, and I'd be taking that car apart after work every single day.<br>- Was it the same kids who took all the keys off of every keyboard in the school and put them back rearranged into perfect sonnets?<br>- Come to think of it, the Dreamweaver Academy said that they were extremely skilled students.

                "Desc": "<br><b>1. Old Warehouse</b><br><br><b>Original Version:</b><br><br>My roommate heard this from a senior who graduated years ago: Rumor has it that the library has a huge abandoned underground warehouse. This warehouse is absolutely enormous, and they use it to store discarded textbooks, outdated bestsellers, and old magazines.<br><br>Just like how books in the real world can become worm-eaten if stored improperly in the real world, some \"things\" also started growing in these books. The senior wasn't sure what they were, but she guessed it was probably monsters like Memory Zone Memes... Either way, the entire library area was blocked off for a while and Bloodhounds constantly went in and out of the building. Moreover... some of those people who went in never came out...<br><br>There was one brave student who tried to sneak in but didn't manage to. When he talked to other students about it afterward, he said he heard an extremely terrifying roar coming from under the ground before the Bloodhounds found him.<br><br>The library re-opened not long after, and it all seemed the same as before, except that the door that led to the warehouse was nowhere to be seen.<br><br><b>Popular Variant:</b><br><br>Some people claim that there is a Crisis Era Memory Zone Meme hidden below the library. This version is from the thread on supernatural phenomena on the student forums. The original content is as follows:<br><br>\"Unlike ordinary memes, this meme had developed a human-like appearance and intellect after prolonged exposure to humanity and had become extremely difficult to deal with. It was only suppressed and sealed underneath the library after a united effort from the Bloodhound Family, the Garden of Recollection, and the IPC.\"<br><br><b>Author's Comments:</b><br><br>The author attempted to find further information regarding the variant version but was unsuccessful. However, the mention of \"Paperfold University was founded to use the massive number of students' subconscious to suppress this meme\" could link the two stories and allow for further discoveries.<br><br><br><b>2. The Bird in the Mist</b><br><br><b>Original Version:</b><br><br>Oh, that? I know that story. It happened around that fountain southwest of the Charmony Academy... Rumor has it that loads of people experienced this, and it was nearly always the same thing. They were all walking on their own when a dense fog suddenly came out of nowhere. They couldn't see anything, and they couldn't get out of it no matter which direction they walked in. The only way out was to follow the bird calls in the mist, and you could only return to reality when you reached the fountain.<br><br>Although... I heard that someone from Fortune Academy saw this whole thing unfold. He said the unfortunate fool who got \"lost\" just mindlessly walked around the fountain the whole time.<br><br><b>Popular Variant:</b><br><br>As for the bird calls in the mist, the most popular opinion right now is that those are actually the calls of a Dreamweaver who lost their life in an accident during the academy's construction, and whose soul was transformed into an Origami Bird.<br><br>Why are they guiding the way for people? Some say that they are protecting the students. Some say they've been alone for so long and just want to play hide-and-seek with people.<br><br><b>Author's Comments:</b><br><br>The cartoon avatars from the \"Clockie\" series have always had important roles in the spread and evolution of Penaconian local ghost stories.<br><br>Different Moments have different versions regarding the legend of the \"Origami Bird.\" The details of these stories are influenced by their local cultures' features (for example, in Golden Hour, the spirit's identity is often described as a Dreamchaser). However, the narrative structure (such as the change of POV) and main elements (the mist, getting lost, and the bird calls) remain largely the same.<br><br><br><b>3. The Shape Shifting Professor</b><br><br><b>Original Version:</b><br><br>I never witnessed this for myself, but this is what they all say... Also, if you ask me, it's really not that strange even if it is true! You know that Fortune Academy professor that everyone hates? The one that takes the register for every elective class and has a super-high fail rate?<br><br>Rumor has it that he transformed into a balloon a few days ago... Apparently, he announced during a lecture that there was going to be an on-the-spot in-class test, and anyone who failed would have their grades deducted at the end of the semester. A student argued with him and the professor said, \"You want me to cancel the test? Only if I turn into a balloon right now!\"<br><br>Also... I heard that this balloon is bright red with a wonky laughing clown face crudely drawn on it.<br><br><b>Popular Variant:</b><br><br>In other known versions, the reasons for the clash between the student and the professor include: Creating difficulties for struggling students, abusing students who are dating each other (believing that they were disrupting the order of the class), and serious professional mistakes during class (that they refuse to admit to save their reputation).<br><br><b>Author's Comments:</b><br><br>During the course of my research, the author noticed an intriguing phenomenon: In contrast to other ghost stories, the storytellers in this one tended to lean in more of a \"proactive\" attitude.<br><br>In the narrative process, the majority seem to express a certain amount of gratification and satisfaction (to the point of even reveling in this person's misfortune). What's more, they often use subtle looks and hand movements or use \"humor\" to cover up their aggression (toward certain unpopular professors).<br><br><br><b>4. Fail Message</b><br><br><b>Original Version:</b><br><br>This makes me so ■■■■ing mad! I don't believe it for one bit, but this is just bad vibes! What kind of bored, lazy ■■■■■■ sits around sending these evil spam messages all day!? Look, look! Is this what anyone sane would do?<br><br>\"Make sure you send this message to 20 people within 3 days, or you'll fail every compulsory course this semester! Don't believe me? Wait and see~\"<br><br>I hear that everyone who got this message and didn't send it on actually did fail... You don't think this is some cruel trick by one of the professors, do you? ■■■■, this little ■■■■■■■ better hope I don't get my hands on them, or I'll knock the living ■■■■ out of them!<br><br><b>Popular Variant:</b><br><br>Regarding the origin of the message, there are a number of popular opinions currently: The suspects are students who have been held back for many years due to poor grades, top students who lost their scholarships due to shady scandals, and scheming old professors who hate young people.<br><br><b>Author's Comments:</b><br><br>Whoever it was, they'd have to be a real twisted sicko to come up with something like this.<br><br><br><b>5. The Space-Time Intersection</b><br><br><b>Original Version:</b><br><br>You know, actually... I feel like... It's just my personal feeling! But, I think this sounds quite romantic. Ahem... you get it, right? It's that feeling of \"traversing time and space only so they can be together!\"<br><br>Uhh... Alright, I'll be serious. You know where that desk is, right? That one. The one in the last row of the self-study room in the very end of the third floor, next to the window. My friend's friend once tried leaving a message on it, and she got a reply from a ghost that was apparently one of Dean Glaux's former students...<br><br>Huh? No, of course she didn't go missing. It wasn't some strange curse or something like that. Their conversation was brief but very delightful. Other than the inability to prove whether this was true or not, the whole thing was amazing. That's why I said it's just like the plot of a movie or something. Don't you think?<br><br><b>Popular Variant:</b><br><br>The main difference between the various versions of this ghost story is the \"extent of danger.\" In the original telling, the ghost was completely harmless. However, as it spread, versions with various horror elements such as \"a curse,\" \"a price to pay,\" and \"gone missing\" began to spread.<br><br><b>Author's Comments:</b><br><br>As ghost stories are passed down, the storytellers often add extra \"details\" to keep the story alive. With this particular example, the popularity and extent of the spread varied significantly between the original version and the later variations.<br><br>Other commonly seen techniques include giving the ghost story a more complete narrative structure (such as foreshadowing and callbacks), more detailed imagery (such as giving more detailed descriptions of the victims and rescuers), forming a closer association with local folklore or personal experience (allowing certain targets to empathize with the situation more), etc.<br><br><br><b>6. The Shade of the Tree</b><br><br><b>Original Version:</b><br><br>This is another incident that I have only heard about... But I never went back to that garden in our academy after I heard it.<br><br>In the northeast corner of the garden, there's a giant banyan tree. You know it, right? Rumor has it that a couple was secretly meeting under that tree. At first, everything was great, but then the leaves above their head started to rustle wildly, and they could hear a faint panting sound like cats or small animals fighting among the leaves.<br><br>The noise completely ruined the mood, so the couple went away. It wasn't until the next day that they heard that someone had hanged themselves on that very tree. It's said that the poor guy wasn't able to wake up on time for some reason, and had a complete mental breakdown after suffering a long and drawn-out \"death.\"<br><br><b>Popular Variant:</b><br><br>Most of the original features of this story remained as it spread, and only varying amounts of detail were added. For example, some versions added details about an argument the couple had after they were disturbed, and one version gave a detailed description of the couple's reactions after they learned the truth.<br><br><b>Author's Comments:</b><br><br>Compared with \"The Space-Time Intersection,\" this ghost story already has a relatively complete narrative structure and titillating clickbait elements from its conception. Therefore, people leaned more towards \"enriching\" the story than \"altering\" it as it spread.<br><br>Regarding the enduring issue of \"How could someone experiencing extreme stimulation in the dream not wake up immediately,\" which involves the fundamental safety measures of the Dreamscape system — I can only say that people will often ignore logic to a certain extent when they are seeking to satisfy their desire and intense curiosity for a good scare.<br><br><br><b>7. Delayed Graduation</b><br><br><b>Original Version:</b><br><br>If you ask me, I'd say that learning too much about finance would mess up your head! This guy was two years above me, never really said a word, and didn't have any friends, so no one paid him much attention.<br><br>Then... I heard that his graduation was pushed back because of poor grades and the pressure drove him crazy. Now and then he'd get up to fancy ways to kill himself. I'm dead serious. Jumping off of school buildings, drowning himself in the swimming pool, hanging himself in the giant banyan tree... Although people almost always managed to stop him in time, he was a real shock to see around the school at the time.<br><br>What happened after? I don't know what happened to him after that. Some say that he got so used to danger in the dream world that he couldn't differentiate when he went back to reality and actually got himself killed.<br><br>Either way, I haven't seen him this semester.<br><br><b>Popular Variant:</b><br><br>According to my research statistics, similar ghost stories exist in every Paperfold University academy. The reasons for the protagonist's trauma include failed romances, family problems, school bullying, exclusion by teachers, or other personal factors. Most of the stories end in the protagonist's actual death (because they could not differentiate between dreams and reality).<br><br><b>Author's Comments:</b><br><br>This particular ghost story serves as a stern warning: The reason behind the student's trauma reflects the pressure and anxiety that are commonly present within students, and the story's ending shows people's latent concern regarding the safety of entering the dream.<br><br><br><b>8. Slumbernana Monkey</b><br><br><b>Original Version:</b><br><br>Investigation ongoing<br><br><b>Popular Variant:</b><br><br>Investigation ongoing<br><br><b>Author's Comments:</b><br><br>*\"Slumbernana Monkey,\" which recently shot into popularity, has suddenly disappeared. Everyone's reactions are exceedingly \"normal\" regarding this disappearance, which is extremely suspicious.<br><br><br><b>9. Rusty Ink Radio Station</b><br><br><b>Original Version:</b><br><br>Investigation ongoing<br><br><b>Popular Variant:</b><br><br>Investigation ongoing<br><br><b>Author's Comments:</b><br><br>*There is definitely something fishy about that radio station! I don't care if no one believes me. I will get to the bottom of this!"

Bite wounds that extend over a large area, from the patient's neck to his chest. Toxins in the wounds have caused the surrounding flesh to decay and atrophy. Patient is in acute shock due to severe blood loss. Fractured clavicle observed.<br>2. Patient had consumed Tumbledust, resulting in disturbed blood circulation, massive internal bleeding, neurological atrophy, and optic neuropathy, leading to function blindness.<br>3. Damage to liver and kidney functions and impaired lymphatic and immune system due to toxins in the body.<br>4. Severe blood loss, compounded by myelosuppression. Inflammation observed.<br>5. Patient had dilated pupils and an abnormally low body temperature when first discovered.<br><br><b>Treatment Plan</b><br>1. Clean the wounds with Pathovore Bugs, apply medication, and dress the wounds. Topically apply Jade Marrow Diffusion to the bone fracture and stabilize it with a fixator.<br>2. Use concoctive acupuncture to stimulate 36 major and minor acupuncture points, including the Yuji, Zhongfeng, Taichong, and Dazhui. Then, activate meridians using incense walker to encourage detoxification. As a complementary treatment, use Vonwacq leeches to drain residual extravasated blood caused by internal bleeding of the organs.<br>3. Have the Vidyadhara High Elder personally inject Draconic Ichor dewdrops, which promote skin and muscle regeneration and healing, into the patient.<br>4. The patient can also ingest tonics that promote tissue regeneration and have blood nourishment effects. This will help the patient regain his strength. Herbal baths are also recommended to help flush toxins from the body. When taking a herbal bath, the patient should take care to protect the wounds from direct contact with the bathwater while immersing his entire body.<br><br><br><b>Current State</b><br>1. Patient is in good spirits and has a good appetite. Although generally sleeping well, he experiences occasional nightmares. Use of Dreambranch Incense to calm the mind is recommended. Wounds are healing slower than expected, but there are no signs of infection so far.<br>2. Vital signs are normal. No lycanthropic symptoms have been observed so far.<br>3. Past consumption of Tumbledust has resulted in the patient's reduced ability to coagulate blood. Make sure to keep sharp instruments out of patient's reach.<br>4. Patient's vision is severely impaired, likely due to optic nerve damage that led to pathological changes in the eye. Treatment to be decided after further examination.<br>5. As the patient's condition meets the basic requirements for discharge, and he has requested to be discharged, he is now declared medically fit for discharge.<br><br><b>Doctor's Post-Discharge Advice</b><br>1. If the patient experiences nightmares caused by residual Lupitoxin in the body, he may use fragrances that calm the mind to help him fall asleep more easily.<br>2. Avoid spicy foods at all costs! The patient should adhere strictly to the advised dietary restrictions if he doesn't want his wounds to become inflamed.<br>3. Patient is to regularly report on how his wounds are healing. In view of the patient's plans to return to his homeland, assistance from the Yaoqing's Alchemy Commission in further diagnoses would be highly appreciated.<br><br><br>Lingsha, Alchemy Commission"

                "Desc": "Since its inception, the Xianzhou Wardance has consistently showcased a myriad of heroes. Yet, after each tournament concludes, only the winner becomes the talk of the town, and other participants are quickly forgotten. How tragic!<br><br>Although I am not a martial artist, I have long held deep sentiments from watching the clashes of heroes and the rivalries of the mighty. Not wishing for these extraordinary tales from the arena to be lost to time and forgotten by all, I have taken up my pen to record their deeds, so that future generations may have a chance to appreciate their predecessors.<br><br><b>1. Neutron Swordmaster</b><br><br>A nameless swordmaster who showed up at the Wardance alone, carrying a pair of longswords forged from two neutron stars on their back. Each three feet long, these indestructible swords cut through steel like a hot knife through butter. Only masters who have honed both their bodies and skills to perfection can wield them efficiently.<br><br>In their first match — one worthy of being hailed as a clash of the finest heroes and blades — Neutron Swordmaster faced off against an opponent wielding a blade forged from a white dwarf. The two engaged in a fierce swordfight, thoroughly enjoying themselves as they pitted their skills against each other. Little did they know, however, that the intense clash between neutron star and white dwarf would hammer out a mini-wormhole right in the arena! In an instant, the wormhole swallowed Neutron Swordmaster's opponent whole, transporting them to an unknown corner of the galaxy. The fan-favorite swordmaster was then tasked by the tournament organizers to find the missing contestant, leaving Xianzhou and embarking on a journey across the universe in search of them.<br><br>As for what comes after, that's a story for another time.<br><br><b>2. Spider-Boy Dodoconey</b><br><br>As you may know, the Wardance is not only open to the Xianzhou people but also to the entire universe, often attracting skilled outworlders to compete in it. In my opinion, the most outstanding Outworlder in this year's tournament is undoubtedly Spider-Boy Dodoconey.<br><br>By leveraging his biological advantage and undergoing relentless training, Dodoconey can wield eight different weapons simultaneously with his eight arms, each using a combat technique corresponding to the weapon. It is said that before competing in the Wardance, Dodoconey once trained under the galaxy's martial arts grandmaster, Wraithcave. While under Wraithcave's tutelage, Dodoconey traveled to eight planets with extreme environments, where he eventually mastered Octorealm, the famed ultimate technique that made him unbeatable in the arena.<br><br>However, Dodoconey ultimately did not make it to the end, instead falling on the stage in his fourth match. The reason? Being a telepathic spider, Dodoconey was well past the age to be called Spider-Boy. You guessed it right — he died of old age!<br><br><b>3. Void Song Whale Ulpo</b><br><br>If one were to ask me to name the contestant with the least showmanship in the Wardance, it would undoubtedly be Ulpo, sect master of The Void Song Whale Fist and one of the successors to Xianzhou's ancient pictographic boxing arts. Long before the tournament even began, this Vidyadhara martial artist had already garnered a large following among fellow practitioners due to his outstanding skills and good looks. His famous tagline? \"None can withstand a strike of The Void Song Whale Fist. If they do, then knock them out with one more!\"<br><br>And true enough, Ulpo has perfected this technique. Compared to the eccentric moves of his fellow sect members, Ulpo's battle style is remarkably straightforward. He simply strikes repeatedly with The Void Song Whale Fist, easily overpowering opponents with sheer brute strength.<br><br>While I believe that martial arts should not only be practical but also aesthetically appealing, my opinion ultimately did not matter, as Ulpo had to withdraw from the tournament due to family disputes. A true shame!<br><br><b>4. Danil and Aurumaton XIV</b><br><br>The reason I've grouped these two together is not only because they are both Intellitrons. More importantly, they are both disciples of Wraithcave and possess the special ability to predict their opponent's next move. Their formidable computational power allowed them to cruise through the tournament... until they faced each other.<br><br>In their match, Danil went first and started predicting their opponent's next move. In keeping up with Danil, Aurumaton XIV, too, began to predict the former's next move. In turn, Danil went on to predict Aurumaton XIV's subsequent move, and so forth. Eventually, the two Intellitrons entered a logic deadlock where neither made a single move, and the helpless organizers had no choice but to carry them off the arena.<br><br>Although the organizers in Xianzhou have expressed that these two contestants will retain their eligibility to participate in the next Wardance despite not finishing their match, I can't help but be concerned nonetheless. After all, even if countless Amber Eras were to pass, their duel would likely remain unfinished. But I suppose this is a fine example of what an ancient Xianzhou martial artist once said:<br>\"Students taught by the same master can never outplay one another.\"<br><br><b>5. Cloudfreed</b><br><br>In its long history, the rules of the Luminary Wardance have been changed and refined numerous times. However, there are always situations that defy common sense in this vast universe, putting everyone involved in a dilemma. This is also why Cloudfreed, a contestant unknown to most, has been included in these records.<br><br>Cloudfreed's age and race are unknown, and the Cloud Metamorphosis technique they practice is characterized by the obfuscation of the boundary between material and consciousness. The further the practitioner advances in the technique, the more incorporeal their form becomes. Up until this point, readers of these records may be inclined to think that Cloudfreed is but one of the odder contestants in a field of masters. Yet, I would implore you to read on before jumping the gun.<br><br>During the final match, Cloudfreed finally attained the ultimate form of this technique. Their corporeal body was stripped away until they fully became a spiritual being. To describe this phenomenon in a scientific manner: They had turned into a memetic entity. Cloudfreed, as a memetic entity, could not attack those with material forms. Similarly, their opponent had no way of hitting them either. The two could only stare helplessly at each other in the arena. According to the competition rules, a memetic entity is ineligible to compete... But what if the contestant had had a corporeal form before stepping into the arena? This lack of clarification resulted in the organizers having a hard time determining the victor of this bout.<br><br>Cloudfreed did not take this outcome to heart, however. After yelling \"I've finally done it!\", he flew away from the arena, never to return again."

There are even people who think that I'm a heartless monster. Therefore, I feel the need to elaborate further on my reasoning to avoid creating any further misunderstandings.<br><br>Firstly, at present, the only Xianzhou ship that has established diplomatic relations with Claretwheel Temple is the Luofu. Even if we disregard our compatriots who are physically too far away and those who have gone into recluse, at the very least, we should avoid deepening our relationship with Claretwheel Temple before the Yaoqing and the Zhuming have passed their judgment.<br><br>Secondly, it has only been thirty years since the Third Denizens of Abundance War. The term \"Denizens of Abundance\" is still one that reminds many Xianzhou residents of hatred and bloodshed. This is even before we talk about the thousand-year blood debt between the foxian and borisin. Such hatred is not something that a few thousand monks can overcome in such a short time (even if they are truly all extremely kind and pure of heart).<br><br>Thirdly, after we form an alliance with Claretwheel Temple, would they still be willing to live by themselves in that dilapidated temple? Even if they were willing, they would undoubtedly become the focus of the Denizens of Abundance's hatred after allying with us. Could we really allow ourselves to let them stay there? That's not how the Xianzhou treats its guests.<br><br>If we allow them to stay on the Luofu instead, what would be our attitude towards their customs and faith? Shall we forbid them from practicing such rituals? That's also not how the Xianzhou treats its guests.<br><br>However, if we allow them to do as they please, they would naturally adhere to their beliefs, which involve capturing baby abominations from various battlefields and putting these creatures in the temple in an attempt to reform them. While the temple still wanders the universe, this behavior is naturally none of our concern. However, once the temple is situated on the Luofu, can you be certain that these mini abominations will not escape the temple and slaughter the innocent on our streets? Should that happen, which one of you would be willing to take responsibility?<br><br>If none of you have any confidence in coming up with a concrete and appropriate plan for their living arrangement, then I suggest that we give up on this idea right now.<br><br>Fourth, perhaps you are not aware of this fact, but investigations from the Intelligentsia Guild show that the 13,000 \"golden bodhisattvas\" enshrined in the Nirvana Hall of Claretwheel Temple are still technically \"alive\" from a biological point of view.<br><br>We do not know whether these \"golden bodhisattvas\" will awaken when certain conditions are met, nor do we know whether they will be \"esteemed high monks\" or \"Abominations of Abundance\" when they awaken.<br><br>In conclusion, on behalf of the Realm-Keeping Commission, I would like to re-emphasize our stance: We should avoid any further cooperation with Claretwheel Temple and abandon any naive notion of allying with them.<br><br>Huifu, Realm-Keeping Commissioner"

                "Desc": "I am writing this letter to report on the recent changes and upcoming plans of the Alchemy Commission:<br><br>Since Dan Shu's rebellion, the reputation of the Luofu Alchemy Commission has taken a major hit and we have lost the trust that people had in us. There are many voices of criticism toward the Alchemy Commission. As the Cauldron Master of the Alchemy Commission, I will implement three measures that aim to lead the Alchemy Commission out of this troubled state.<br><br>Firstly, considering the previous isolation and corruption of the Luofu Alchemy Commission, I propose that we break down this wall and invite renowned healers from both within and outside the Alliance to visit and share ideas. At the same time, we will increase the quota of people we dispatch in exchange, encouraging healers and alchemists from the Commission to learn from the outside and enrich their treatment methods.<br><br>Secondly, I will introduce and impart the incense walker technique of the Xianzhou Zhuming as a form of treatment in the Luofu Alchemy Commission. For frontline soldiers who are constantly battling against the Abominations of Abundance, it is common for them to suffer trauma, and the chances of them becoming mara-struck during and after battle are far greater than the commonfolk. This is a reason why they have frequently been targeted by the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus' temptations. The treatment of the Zhuming focuses on using volatile medication to calm the patient's emotions and temper their physical condition. This has shown great efficacy in slowing down and suppressing the process of becoming mara-struck.<br><br>To do so, I will establish a dedicated team within the Alchemy Commission. They will conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanism for incense treatment and aim to combine it with existing treatment methods employed in the Luofu. They will also optimize the preparation and application processes to ensure the treatment is safe and effective. In the future, alchemists will also be sent to the frontline to treat wounded Cloud Knights and provide them with medicines and medical training. We hope that this can reduce the prejudice that people have toward the Alchemy Commission.<br><br>Thirdly, the Alchemy Commission will strengthen our cooperation with other commissions.

It was originally established to honor the Cloud Knights who guarded the Xianzhou ships and cleansed the plagues under the orders of Reignbow Arbiter. The Cloud Knights of Xianzhou worked diligently and competed in martial arts to honor those who had made sacrifices.<br><br>Over time, the vision for the Luminary Wardance far exceeded a mere tournament and celebration. It eventually evolved into an opportunity for bonding. The Wardance is an opportunity for us to bridge the distance across the universe and invite martial artists from different planets of the cosmos to share the stage, where they can display their fighting spirit and demonstrate the value of alliance.<br><br>Today, you will witness the participants' might and enjoy the sceneries around the Xianzhou.<br><br><b>Overview of the Tournament Venue</b><br><br>The venue of this Luminary Wardance is the Skysplitter. The Skysplitter was once an active fighter jet in service during the Third Denizens of Abundance War. Out of the combat starskiffs of similar tonnage, the Skysplitter has transported countless Cloud Knight heroes to the battlefield and provided low-altitude support for ground forces during the Battle of the Fanghu, the Assault of Sakin Chadu, the Insect Disaster of Karalik, and many other notable campaigns.<br><br>After receiving numerous accolades and amassing various scars throughout the years, the Skysplitter was decommissioned peacefully. Subsequently, the craftsmen of the Artisanship Commission removed its combat armor, and it was now ready to welcome guests with a completely new look. In the months it took to modify and renovate it, the internal cabins of the Skysplitter were completely redesigned to suit various needs including being used by contestants for preparation, by the audience to watch the tournament, by the media for broadcasts, to welcome external guests, for food and entertainment, and even host various commercial events.<br><br><b>Tournament Area: Where Skill Meets Passion</b><br><br>The Viewing Zone and the Finals Zone are located on the massive open-air deck at the center of the Skysplitter. What used to be internal cabins and the lower deck have been remodeled and now serve as the Preliminary Zones. This allows the spectators to get up close and personal to experience the thrill of battle.<br><br>In the Preliminary Zones, there is an internal ring road on the bottom level, a landing pad, and multiple functional rooms. The area is also equipped with medical rooms, training rooms, rest areas, and recreational areas to allow competitors the opportunity to properly train and rest in between their matches.<br><br><b>Viewing and Leisure: Enjoying Every Moment</b><br><br>The Viewing Zones located throughout the Skysplitter provide an unobstructed view of the tournament. They are also equipped with comfortable seats and real-time data analysis on the screens to ensure that spectators can understand what's going on in the matches as they enjoy the visual spectacle. There are also VIP rooms and Media Zones available to suit the business needs of different individuals.<br><br>The Resting Zone and Dining Zone on the Skysplitter serve specialty delicacies from all over the cosmos. There is also Luofu cuisine provided by multiple dining establishments from areas such as Aurum Alley and Exalting Sanctum, building an ideal place to relax and socialize after enjoying the matches.<br><br>During the tournament, special events such as cultural exchange sessions and contestant meet-and-greets will also be organized on the Skysplitter. For more details, please refer to the official announcements.<br><br><b>Exploring the Ship: Echoes of History</b><br><br>Experience the history of the Luofu's Sky-Faring Commission as well as the life of the Skysplitter — from its construction to its deployment, up until it was decommissioned and repurposed — through holographic images and physical exhibits by stepping into the History Gallery located at the bow of the ship. Let us witness how new legends are forged in this vast sea of stars together.<br><br>Even though the command center no longer serves the role of a military command center, the original control panels and strategic astral charts have still been retained. This allows visiting tourists to immerse themselves and take on the role of captain of the ship, and experience what it's like to take part in strategic planning.<br><br><b>Opening Hours</b><br><br>The tournament takes place between 04:00 to 16:00 system time each day. During this period, the Viewing Zone will be open to visitors. For special events and the evening light shows, please refer to the official announcements.<br><br><b>Collecting Tickets</b><br><br>Tickets can be reserved through the official platform or purchased at designated ticketing outlets. Ticket holders can enjoy fully guided tours and viewing rights in certain special zones. Please do not trust any unofficial ticketing platform and be careful not to fall for scams.<br><br><b>Traffic Guide</b><br><br>At various locations such as Exalting Sanctum, there are exclusive starskiffs that go straight to the connecting platform below the Skysplitter. For those driving themselves, please register with the Sky-Faring Commission and park in the designated area.<br><br><b>Safety Notice</b><br><br>To ensure the safety of everyone on board, please be sure to adhere to the signs and follow instructions from the staff when visiting. Refrain from touching any equipment without permission.<br><br>Finally, we hope that you have an enjoyable Luminary Wardance and that you will experience the sincerity of the organizers. We wish you a pleasant journey ahead.<br><br>Luminary Wardance Tournament Committee"

I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the seriousness of the incident and clarify our position. I hope you will regard this with great importance and take immediate corrective measures.<br>At the beginning of this month, New Londinium, a transport ship belonging to our company's Logistics and Transportation Department, was scheduled to sail for the battlefield on the border of the Klimt Republic. However, as the ship was sailing along the Luofu route, it was attacked by a borisin beast ship. Fortunately, with the help of a ship of Zhuming envoys, it managed to escape. According to the relevant risk-avoidance clauses stipulated in the \"Trade Security Cooperation Framework: Mutual Emergency Assistance and Trade Promotion Agreement\" signed between our company and the Xianzhou Alliance, the attacked ship had no choice but to anchor in the Luofu's skyport.<br>However, although our vessel had anchored temporarily due to extenuating circumstances, the Sky-Faring Commission insisted that we provide detailed information about our cargo in accordance to the regulations on goods for foreign trade and carried out inspections. Our personnel made multiple attempts at negotiation and repeatedly reiterated that this batch of goods involved the IPC's intellectual property and commercial secrets, but it did not result in any change in attitude from your end. Not only were the goods detained, but we were also ordered to open the shipment for inspection. It is appallingly obvious that the Sky-Faring Commission has disregarded our perfectly logical and justifiable explanation and abused its power while handling this incident, which completely violates the consensus of business principles between both parties.<br>I cannot help but ask: Does the Sky-Faring Commission frequently abuse its power to forcibly seize the goods of foreign companies? For companies that adhere to business principles, this abuse of power will only lead to disappointment in the Luofu's overall management standards and concept of the rule of law.<br>In light of the above situation, I would like to put forward our demands on behalf of the IPC:<br>1. Immediately return all goods belonging to the New Londinium and propose a departure date.<br>2. Assess and compensate all commercial losses incurred during the period of detention.<br>3. Issue a public apology to compensate for the reputational damage caused by this incident and restore our company's reputation.<br>We sincerely hope that through direct communication and negotiation between both parties, this dispute can be resolved amicably in a satisfactory manner as soon as possible, so as to avoid unnecessary legal disputes and negative impact on trade relations. We hope that you will attach great importance to this matter.<br>Thank you.<br>Sincerely,<br>Lyndon Skott, Special Commissioner, Interastral Peace Corporation"

                "Desc": "...<br>...<br><br>After the Third Denizens of Abundance war, the borisin's political landscape was plunged into a state of extreme instability. There are still many existing splinter factions and new powers that are being consolidated that we have not identified. This is what the scouts of the Verdantia Fleet have gathered thus far about borisin, for the perusal of the Cloud Knights.<br><br>Currently, the borisin world is governed by six major packs: Eclipse, Chiseltooth, Sableclaw, Bloodwind, Rhinohound, and Whitewolf.<br><br>Eclipse Pack<br><br>The Eclipse Pack is most adept at marauding. Its founder proclaimed to have devoured the flesh of gods, and was thus crowned the God-Devouring Hunter. This pack's borisin have reaped the greatest boons from the Moon Rage, able to enter a berserk state during the phenomenon — they call it the Crimson Moon's Ire.<br><br>The Eclipse Pack's tradition allows them to feast on the flesh of other races, resulting in them possessing astounding rates of mutation. Their own body is a genetic machine that is constantly self-evolving, enhancing itself through the replenishment of the genetic information of other species genetic information. When combating the Eclipse, post-battle cleanup must be performed meticulously — don't leave any of your peers' corpses on the field. This isn't a question of glory or sentimentality, but a principle that must be adhered to.<br><br>Chiseltooth Pack<br><br>Rather than combat, the Chiseltooth Pack is more proficient at genetic witchcraft. Borisin typically use mechabeasts and weapons, and these technological rudiments are mainly assembled by the Chiseltooth Pack's genetic warlocks.<br><br>Even in the most brutal age of civil strife, no pack has ever dared attack the Chiseltooth Pack. Attacking their genetic warlocks would incur the borisin culture's collective wrath — an act that would earn the entire race's retaliation. The Xianzhou Yaoqing have successfully framed attacks against the Chiseltooth on other borisin tribes — a tactic that has paid dividends in scale.<br><br>Based on the Chiseltooth Pack's complex biotechnology, during their temporary cooperation, the Verdantia Fleet and the Intelligentsia Guild produced a medicinal pellet effective in resisting most of the microbe weaponry that they spray. Please confirm that your loadout consists of this medicine or a similar agent before deploying for combat.<br><br>Sableclaw Pack<br><br>The Sableclaw Pack serves as borisin mercenaries. You may run into them on any battlefield. They are both hardy and excellent at concealment, adept at hunting, assassination, and terrorist tactics.<br><br>Their olfactory senses far surpass other borisin, to the point where they've developed a highly effective olfactory language used for pack hunting. This is why, when encountering Sableclaw Pack enemies, it is a good idea to sever their links to one another through their sense of smell. The current counter-tactic of the Verdantia Fleet is to release smell disruptors and counter pheromones. Before deploying, every soldier should be equipped with at least two units of counter-entrapment inhibitors (code-named \"Perfume\").<br><br>Bloodwind Pack<br><br>The Bloodwind Pack is the most prolific in beast-riding and divination among borisin. They have the largest beast ship fleet and is capable of rallying swift transport for the entire tribe. Also, their superb mobility prevents us from accurately pinpointing their main base, but they can intermittently disrupt and raid our key installations.<br><br>In this era of Borisin Empire's absolute decline, the Bloodwind Pack may, possibly, be the faction that would pose the most danger to the Alliance in the future.<br><br><i>(A biological recognition tag that redirects to a pilot training program's registration page is attached at the bottom of the file. Unfortunately, you obviously have no way to open it.)</i><br><br>Rhinohound Pack<br><br>The Rhinohound Pack is currently the youngest among all packs. It is an anomaly among borisin, a race that pursues hunting as a way of life. They revel in intensive agriculture among their settled planets and are highly adept at defensive strategies.<br><br>It is this cultural trait that makes the Rhinohound Pack highly skilled in business, as well as their strict behavioral adherence to keeping relative peace. Such a style of conduct has allowed them to establish relations with some factions (such as the IPC) for mutual trade.<br><br>Different from most borisin who pursue the advancement in biological tech, the Rhinohound Pack is far more interested in studying industrial methods that enhance flesh and bone. After their coming-of-age rite, Rhinohound Pack younglings will receive their first powered exoskeleton armor. This is also the origin of their \"Rhinohound\" namesake — the name of an indomitable divine beast in borisin lore.<br><br>Many borisin believe that the Rhinohound Pack has betrayed the sacred way of life that the Father Wolf Duran founded, while some young borisin believe that the Rhinohounds are the future moving forward.<br><br>Rhinohound Pack members are occasionally or frequently capable of negotiation discourse, but don't hold out too much hope. Borisin will always be borisin — when you show fear or bleed, they will reveal their true nature, and speak with their armaments instead.<br><br>Whitewolf Pack<br><br>Among the six major packs, the Whitewolf Pack may be the most special, and the most wicked of the lot. It is the only borisin pack not led by borisin, but foxians, who call themselves \"Whitewolves\" within the pack.<br><br>Over seven centuries ago, after Hoolay's capture by the Alliance, intense civil strife exploded among borisin. Capitalizing on this chaos, a group of foxian slaves chose to rise in revolt. In this earth-shattering slave rebellion, the leader who called themself the Whitewolf Khan slew their own master and led their forces in the occupation of the pack's planet. Borisin were unable to quash this rebellion, and the Whitewolf Khan's kingdom has remained to this day.<br><br>Presently, led by foxians, the brutal Whitewolf Pack commits the most atrocities among all borisin packs. They rely on such performative zealotry to show themselves as more borisin than the true borisin, to ensure that they never go back to their enslaved fates again.<br><br>The Whitewolf Pack's most common combat tactic is to herd their foxian brethren at close quarters to function as both vanguard and fodder, primarily to rile up the emotions of the enemy frontline (this tactic is also used by other packs, but most frequently by the Whitewolves). Apart from this, they also usually disguise themselves as Xianzhou foxians in battle, yelling out \"Don't attack, I'm one of you\" in the Verdantia tongue, misleading the Cloud Knights into hesitation and confusion, before taking this opportunity to slit their throats.<br><br>Seeing as the Whitewolf Pack is prolific in disguise, infiltration, and assassination from the rear, the Yaoqing Cloud Knights will regularly conduct psychological screen tests on foxian soldiers. If you are a foxian, please update your psychological screen tests regularly, so that the Military Affairs Office has a timely grasp on your status.<br><br>Also, please remember that when crossing blades with the Whitewolf Pack, reject any act of temporary surrender and do not take prisoners of war. Additionally, never allow yourself or your comrades to end up alive in the hands of the Whitewolves. When fighting against them, you must set aside an arrow or bullet for yourself... or any weapon that will let you successfully take your own life.<br><br>Claretwheel Temple<br><br>After the collapse of Borisin Empire, a new faction called the Claretwheel Temple surfaced on our radar.<br><br>The Claretwheel Temple's devotees reject harm on any living thing, instead turning their beliefs to some religious concept as the path of salvation. These borisin oppose the endless Denizens of Abundance Wars — the infighting of their own brethren has caused them to waver. They have resurrected the traditional Verdantia fable of \"Wolf God and Fox God\" and believe that the heart of the present chaos lies in the power imbalance between Abundance and The Hunt.<br><br>The Claretwheel Temple currently has close to ten thousand disciples, most of which are borisin, with a minority of them from the other Denizens of Abundance species. These war-weary denizens have found their safe haven under the protective wing of the monastic Claretwheel Temple masses.<br><br>The Claretwheel Temple's monks can be identified from a distinct characteristic: They all wear some sort of forged metallic bands, usually around a certain part of their body (such as their head or neck). It is a symbol of their advocacy for the precept of never taking lives.<br><br>As unbelievable as the concept of a \"non-killing borisin\" is, from current records, this faction has been confirmed to adhere to the contents of their proclaimed mantra. The Military Affairs Office strictly forbids the deliberate harm of Claretwheel Temple monks — violators of this regulation will be charged with intentional harm to civilians.<br><br>...<br>..."

He betrayed the Alliance and reduced himself to a \"White Wolf\" and I must bear the blame. I am willing to accept my rightful punishment in order to set an example for others.<br><br>However, I must admit that this move by Yanyou does not come as a surprise to me. These \"barbaric\" lifestyles of borisin have a certain fatal attraction to many of those who live within \"civilized societies.\"<br><br>In actual fact, now that the dust has settled on the Third Denizens of Abundance War and borisin are unlikely to be causing any more major disruption, perhaps we are now prepared to face a topic that we never dared face in the past... Are borisin really \"barbaric\"?<br><br>I cannot help but recall a time 148 years ago, when I followed my mentor, Mr. Jielian, to a planet known as Pisdo. At the time, it was a Rhinohound Pack territory.<br><br>We met with the Rhinohound Pack founder — Geliko Khan — as IPC specialists and lived on Pisdo for 6 Star-Calendar months.<br><br>That was the first time that we truly communicated with borisin as equals — not as enemies, nor as prisoners of war or slaves. Even Mr. Jielian, the master who founded the sect of borisin studies, had never had an opportunity like this before.<br><br>Contrary to the common impression one has of borisin chiefs, Geliko Khan had always been thin and frail. In borisin society, where strength rules, a body like this was basically tantamount to an Incomplete One.<br><br>Geliko Khan had not chosen to walk a painful path in which he did not excel. Instead, he chose another path — technological research. He led a team of other young borisin who, like him, either did not excel at or refused to study \"ancient martialism\" and began researching new forms of weaponry that could help to improve their fighting ability.<br><br>Less than a century later, Geliko Khan set up his own tribe of borisin, equipped his people with powered armor exoskeletons, and named them the \"Rhinohounds.\"<br><br>Even to this day, there are many borisin who believe the Rhinohound Pack betrayed the sacred way of life that Duran the Father Wolf had created for them. However, not one of them dares look down on the Rhinohounds for their physical weakness.<br><br>There is a classic misunderstanding regarding borisin culture... Borisin \"respect only the strong,\" so they must only have respect for the most powerful of warriors.<br><br>The truth is actually much more profound than this. Though borisin do indeed \"respect only the strong,\" their definition of \"strong\" is not set in stone, but diverse.<br><br>What is strength in the eyes of borisin? Someone like Hoolay that has the strength of a thousand men? Naturally, that is \"strength.\" What about someone who is as intelligent as Geliko Khan? That is also strength. What about the genetic warlocks of the Chiseltooth Pack who excel at cultivating weaponry and beast ships? That is also strength.<br><br>Over the six months that we lived on Pisdo, I discovered that the diverse evaluation system of borisin society actually led to bustling vitality, not oppression at all.<br><br>Indeed, there are certain jobs that may cause you to lose respect in borisin society, such as a merchant or a farmer — In fact, borisin society doesn't need these two professions at all, aside from the more \"new-age\" Rhinohound Pack. My poor friend Arma was brutally bullied in his hometown due to his desire to become a merchant.<br><br>These jobs aside, the majority of professions — such as warriors, advisers, beast ship operators, doctors, genetic warlocks, priests, and bards... All of these jobs are considered equal in borisin society.<br><br>Even the most powerful warrior would not dare mock a frail but genius poet without careful consideration. If they were to do this, they would be judged as \"disrespecting the strong\" in the borisin social system and be shunned.<br><br>On the other hand, the borisin faith in \"respect only the strong\" has allowed them to really master the concept of \"a hero's roots do not matter.\" As long as you are a borisin and truly revere the Master of Immortality (this I doubt), then no matter how humble your beginnings are, you can rely on your strength alone to lead you to the forefront and write your own history.<br><br>Before the current Great Erkan (top military officer in the borisin tongue) Chiliyan took his post, he was just a weak war slave that Geliko Khan purchased by chance. Word on the streets was that Geliko Khan purchased him simply because he saw his childhood self in this boy.<br><br>According to our rough calculations, there were 14 people alongside Chiliyan who had managed to rise from war slaves to positions of power in Pisdo alone. Naturally, this was partly because Geliko Khan was more liberal-minded, but it also clearly shows how borisin placed more importance on capability than that of birth.<br><br>Is the dreaded Whitewolf Pack of today not yet another example? The foxian slaves rose up and formed their very own pack. Not only did borisin not use their \"slave lineage\" against them, the majority of borisin now fear them due to their savage and merciless actions.<br><br>This \"respect only the strong,\" alongside their pluralistic societal ranking system, has actually birthed a very effective system of policies. No one is free to slack off at a desk for their whole lives, and no one can rest on their laurels and milk past successes for a lifetime. The ones who have decision-making power in military meetings will always be borisin who have true talent.<br><br>Back to my disciple, Yanyou. His parents always believed that cultural anthropology was \"a pointless discipline that will never help you find a job.\" They were so set on this that when he insisted on advancing with his anthropology studies, they cut off all ties with him. Then, when he did make it through all the challenges and entered the academy as he had wished, he discovered that all the \"leading academics\" there (myself included) came from \"academic families\" with thousands of years of history.<br><br>Such people would naturally be attracted to borisin culture of only using meritocracy to select heroes. Though the path that he has taken is undeniably deplorable, is it really surprising?<br><br>Of course, even with this being the case, I am still shocked by his foolishness. As far as borisin are concerned, anthropology is likely an even more meaningless profession. If borisin had just a single ounce of respect for culture and anthropology, they would never have killed Mr. Jielian.<br><br>However, I shall not attempt to deceive the Ten Lords... I also approve of this specific aspect of borisin society. I will point out, however, now that Hoolay has been captured and the Borisin Empire has collapsed, their pure \"respect only the strong\" social norm has started to disappear. Their new generation of aristocrats is becoming more and more \"civilized\" when it comes to their selection of talents, growing more concerned solely for their own \"political bases\" regardless of how this would affect the pack as a whole.<br><br>Nevertheless, for the Xianzhou Alliance, this offers a prime chance to ditch outdated ideologies and adopt lessons from the \"barbarians.\" Embracing a culture where strength rules could rejuvenate the stagnant atmosphere within Xianzhou society.<br><br>Dr. Zongguang, Anthropologist from the Luofu Grand Virtue Academy<br><br>"

I could not be happier for her.<br><br>I imagine that to the majority of my readers, both the name Yewliho and <i>My Return to the Path</i> are likely new to you. So, please allow me to tell you a little about her life in this preamble.<br><br>In the year 7992, Yewliho was born into a Bloodwind Pack beast ship operator family. The Bloodwind Pack \"inspired awe across the universe\" with their gigantic fleet of beast ships. Within a society like borisin that honors strength above all, beast ship operators from this generation, like Yewliho, naturally held a relatively high level of political influence.<br><br>By 8023, Yewliho already had her own personal fleet, the \"Preta,\" at only age 31. She had already independently planned and completed dozens of plunder and ransack missions.<br><br>As far as Xianzhou pilots at the time were concerned, Yewliho was an unparalleled nightmare. She was renowned for her fearless attacks and many schemes, and could be said to lead the most brutal and efficient fleet at that time.<br><br>Before long, thanks to her many military exploits, Yewliho's rank among the pack skyrocketed. In 8025, Yewliho and the Bloodwind Pack Chief Hosing Khan were married.<br><br>As it is borisin tradition for the chief's partner to act as the leader of all officials, Yewliho had suddenly risen to the second-highest rank within the Bloodwind Pack.<br><br>In 8032, Yewliho gave birth to a child named \"Cherluwoo.\" If everything went as planned, Cherluwoo would become the next leader of the pack.<br><br>However, there was an unexpected development the year that Cherluwoo turned 5.<br><br>Originally, Hosing Khan had already exceeded 400 years of age without bearing an heir. If the regular route of succession were to be followed, the title of chief would go to the next \"Duran descendant\"... Hosing Khan's nephew, Kobo.<br><br>However, the birth of Cherluwoo had shattered this plan. After having prepared all his life to inherit the pack, Kobo led the 3,000-strong beast ship fleet that had sworn loyalty to him to reclaim his power and attacked the chief's great beast ship.<br><br>Hosing Khan had no time to react before he was murdered by his bodyguards that Kobo had bribed. Naturally, Kobo's next targets would be Yewliho and her son. <br><br>Fortunately, Yewliho had always retained her own fleet that vowed loyalty to her, the Preta. Although they only boasted 300 ships, every member was a trusted ally that had accompanied her on pillages for many years.<br><br>Yewliho and her fleet successfully forced their way out of Kobo's encirclement. However, with the huge beast ship fleet that pursued them like locusts, there was no way for her mere 300 ships to escape.<br><br>However, \"Kobo Khan\" called off his manhunt a short while later and returned to the Bloodwind Pack, successfully becoming the next chief. Yewliho would never say how she managed to escape that lethal pursuit. All that we know is that her only child, Cherluwoo, died during that escape.<br><br>In the year 8038, Yewliho led the Preta (with 127 men remaining) to the Fanghu, determined to submit and pledge allegiance to the Alliance.<br><br>After two long years of careful deliberation, the Alliance decided to pardon these borisin for their crimes and allow them to live inside the Fanghu under strict surveillance... This was on the condition that they comply with all Alliance research on borisin, as well as submitting all beast ship-related technology to them.<br><br>This was also the time that I met Yewliho. As a cultural anthropologist, I was ordered to interview these 127 borisin, in order to deepen our understanding of borisin society.<br><br>Throughout the course of my research, Yewliho and I developed a deep friendship. She was an intelligent, frank, and courageous warrior who was able to summarize the complex and chaotic world of borisin society and logic to me in concise, clear language.<br><br>Likely because of her hatred towards Kobo, Yewliho always hoped that she would be able to lead her Preta to fight for the Alliance. However, a request like this was unlikely to receive approval.<br><br>Yewliho made this request again and again and was rejected every time... After 30 years, she could bear this cycle no longer and began to seek my assistance.<br><br>I suggested that she write a long letter explaining her life and background in detail. This would allow her to explain her hatred of her enemies to the Seven Arbiter-Generals and why she longs to fight for the Alliance. When she did this, I would be willing to put my personal reputation on the line to vouch for her.<br><br>Two years later, she wrote <i>My Return to the Path</i>.<br><br>Perhaps this was truly some cruel trick of fate... But, in 8072, not long after she had written this letter, the third Denizens of Abundance War broke out.<br><br>With the Fanghu serving as the main battleground, it quickly descended into a terrifying bloodbath. Pressed with their backs up against the wall, no one was free to keep watch over Yewliho... So, without receiving permission from the Alliance, the Preta launched their final assault.<br><br>We never learned just how many Abominations of Abundance the Preta wiped out in the war. However, what we can be sure of is that they managed to transport at least 4,000 civilians to safety before the Reignbow's Lux Arrow descended.<br><br>And during this process, all 127 borisin warriors, including Yewliho perished.<br><br>Due to the sensitive nature of Yewliho's identity and her undeniable past wrongdoings, her story has been concealed under the surface of history to this day. That is why <i>My Return to the Path</i> was never able to be published.<br><br>I have been working hard for years to make sure that <i>My Return to the Path</i> gets published, in the hopes that her story could appear on my readers' desks, like it can today.<br><br>Honestly, I almost don't care about the book's academic merit, I just care about my selfish motives: I want to introduce the story of my friend Yewliho to you all...<br><br>She was an Abomination of Abundance that was full of evil, a covetous thief, and a criminal with blood-soaked hands.<br>She was a Xianzhou person who never gained recognition, a courageous warrior, and a mother filled with rage and sorrow.<br><br>Doctor of Cultural Anthropology at the Luofu Grand Virtue Academy<br>Zongguang<br><br>"

                "Desc": "I am not great at understanding the minds of others, but Zhuming swordsmiths confuse me in particular.<br><br>In the artisan workshops of the Forge, I have witnessed first-hand the mad ecstasy and unparalleled pride of a swordsmith at the sight of their newest marvels of weaponry. I have also seen them disagree endlessly about the creation of all-new weaponry, sometimes even leading to battles of words and swords.<br><br>These people are normally very kind and good people. It's just as if their minds have been completely hijacked when \"forging weapons\" is mentioned. They become exhilarated when imagining the gleam of a freshly forged blade and how it could cut through countless enemies. Weapons that have not even been forged yet speak through their mouths, take form through their blueprints, and harm others through their words. Swords are even more adept than heliobi at stealing the hearts of people.<br><br>My father, Hanguang, was one of these swordsmiths. His vanity and inspiration led him to violate prohibitions and craft all sorts of unbelievable weapons for visitors from foreign lands. Yet, he never provided them with sheaths. So, he himself became the sheath as he fell to one of his very own prided works.<br><br>\"One who loves swords will one day be hurt by swords,\" my grandfather always used to say with a heavy sigh. When you hold a weapon of death in your hands, you will always crave a chance for it to see use. And the weapons my father crafted were more lethal than any other.<br><br>My grandfather never mentioned my father's name ever since I could walk. He also strictly forbade my senior fraters and senior sorors to utter a word. However, this atmosphere of secrecy quickly became an elephant in the room, as if a single tome of swordplay had been removed from a fully stacked bookshelf. The more they remained silent on this matter, the more obvious this silence became.<br><br>In the end, I decided to fill this void. I browsed through tomes of swordplay that had records of his works, and began to search for these swords' whereabouts.<br><br>***<br><br>The \"Crimson Thorn\" was one of his early works. It was three-by-three inches, had a handle, no frame, and no sheath.<br><br>The blade edge of the \"Crimson Thorn\" was not sharpened. It was the color of dulled iron and covered in sharp thorns. Near the tip of the blade, there was an exposed sharp spike that looked like freshly-cast, red-hot iron... It was not shaped like a typical sword, but more like a wooden club with a long thorn protruding from the top.<br><br>According to the blueprints, it was designed to kill the Abominations of Abundance that are capable of rapid healing. The core contained inside the metal body of the blade is a bionic sprout of the Ambrosial Arbor... Where did Hanguang get his hands on such a dangerous object in the first place? No one knows. The only thing we can know is that this sword was crafted at the request of a shadow guard of the Xianzhou Yaoqing specifically to kill the Abominations of Abundance.<br><br>When the sword pierced the body of a long-life species, Crimson Thorn would drain the spirit of the victim, causing their body to wither rapidly. The effects were said to be unbelievable. It's most likely that the thorns were injected with some kind of toxin that inhibited the activity of long-life species' cells... Many of the blades of the Forge seem to have mysterious abilities like this on the surface but are actually quite understandable once you explain the design.<br><br>***<br><br>\"A thorned exterior with a crimson core\" is documented in ancient texts to describe the miracles of the sacred tree, and is considered an omen of great auspice and honor. No matter how lofty the ideals of the former wielder of this blade were in slaughtering Abominations of Abundance, Crimson Thorn had become a weapon dedicated to murdering Cloud Knights as it had fallen into the hands of Thanjar, a Disciple of Sanctus Medicus.<br><br>Now that I had my hunting target, all that was left was to take action. Although my grandfather never approved of my sword-hunting plan, I knew that he was the type of man to say one thing and mean another... When he flicked through my scout report on his desk, I knew that he had come around to the idea.<br><br>Scouts of the Goldencrow Fleet traced Thanjar to the depths of Insumousu. It was here that he was impersonating a Xianzhou citizen to coerce locals and water dwellers to salvage various sunken Daiyu relics for him.<br><br>Once I was certain of my target's location, I immediately boarded a Whistling Flames transport vessel and headed to Insumousu. When I had gone to reclaim the previous swords, it had always just been a case of facing my opponent off in a simple one-on-one duel. However, I feared that this time may not be so simple. Thanjar had hired a group of Annihilation Gang assassins to guard the island of shipwrecked vessels formed on the periphery of the ancient Daiyu ruins.<br><br>I spent a week surveying the topography, counting their manpower, and confirming their weapons of choice. Then, I began my lengthy campaign of guerrilla warfare... I would seize the moment that my target was alone, and wipe out the Annihilation Gang monsters and foul beasts created by the Sanctus Medicus rebels one by one. Each time I cut an enemy down, I would sound my conch shell horn, summoning Thanjar's remaining lackeys to come and see the fate that awaits them: Being reduced to no more than a pile of dust and tar that stinks to the high heavens by Old Mettle here.<br><br>About two weeks passed, and my enemies' morale had been totally crushed. The locals on the shipwreck island began to spread rumors that vengeful spirits from the ship forsaken by the gods had appeared, and despite beatings and hindrances from Thanjar's men, they dived into the water and fled under the cover of night.<br><br>It was a dark, stormy night with roaring winds and crashing waves when I decided this battle must end. The remaining Sanctus Medicus demons and bandits were no trouble for me, but the battle took a grave turn when Thanjar himself came forward... Because the \"Crimson Thorn\" was actually a living blade. Whenever Old Mettle managed to strike Thanjar, he would brandish his blade at his own men and the \"Crimson Thorn\" would mercilessly absorb their life energy, draining the men and completely healing Thanjar's wounds in an instant.<br><br>Once its blood thirst was quenched, the \"Crimson Thorn\" unfurled and swung through the air like a long vine of thorns. As soon as it touched me, the thorns would extend and latch onto me, piercing my body and leeching my blood and bone marrow.<br><br>Being entangled would undoubtedly leave me in a bad position. So, I came up with a plan to use Old Mettle as cover and aim to land a fatal blow for a decisive victory. When Thanjar had a tight grasp of Old Mettle with the \"Crimson Thorn\" and thought he would be able to take it away from me, I launched the giant sword directly at him, pinning the Discipulus Medicus to a rock with the huge momentum and immobilizing him.<br><br>Then, it became a battle of patience. I watched over this rock for a whole week, yet never approaching the dying Thanjar. His life force was like a campfire that would never die out. In the beginning, he used all his energy to curse and berate me, yet this anger turned to whimpering and begging after a few days. Eventually, the life force that he had stolen using the \"Crimson Thorn\" was finally exhausted. As the sword reverted to its original form of an unremarkable wooden club, I removed it from Thanjar's mummified hands that could no longer offer any resistance, smashed the sword to pieces with Old Mettle, and placed the shattered remains inside a sword box.<br><br>***<br><br>This darned blade had absorbed my blood, making me feel like I had aged hundreds of years in an instant. I had no desire to turn into an old granny just yet, so I stayed in Thalassa to rest up for half a month. Just as I was planning to board a merchant vessel back to the Xianzhou Zhuming, a Xianzhou native blocked my path.<br><br>This man thanked me for killing Thanjar, his rival, and thanked me for destroying a blade that was specifically used to suppress the Discipulus Medicus. Just as I reached for Old Mettle to begin combat, the man told me that to express his thanks, he would share with me some information that I would no doubt have great interest in. He said, \"I happen to know the whereabouts of a number of Hanguang's cursed swords...\"<br><br>I stared blankly at his bald head, suppressing my discontent knowing that I could not crush it, and asked...<br><br><i>\"Well, what did you ask?\"</i><br><i>\"Isn't it rude to peek in a young girl's diary, gramps?\"</i><br><br>"

But, Master Yanqing says that sword styles are the foundation of swordplay, and nothing can ever stand firm on an unstable foundation.

I'm going to lose my mind! Everything Master Yunli teaches is completely different from what Master Yanqing teaches!<br><br>Master Yanqing teaches me to focus on footwork, telling me that I need to move flexibly while being aware of my left and right.

If you have only footwork and no strength, your blade has no destructive power. If you have only brute strength and no footwork, your moves become repetitive and predictable.

                "Desc": "Interrogation transcript<br><br>Culprit: Yancui, female, Spices Supreme head chef<br><br>In direct violation of Xianzhou law, the culprit privately hired a team of armed archaeologists to launch an attack on a borisin beast ship, then devoured it between her and the archaeologists. The content covered in the interrogation is as follows:<br><br>Q: How did you discover the beast ship?<br><br>A: I have a friend... Ah, that isn't just me making an excuse, I really do have a friend in the Intelligentsia Guild who researches interstellar ecology. She observes and pursues borisin hunts and migration all year round.<br><br>A: She recently asked me out of the blue whether I had ever tasted the flavor of a borisin beast ship before. My first instinct at the time was that she'd gone insane. Who has ever eaten a borisin beast ship? Who would even try? However, this question planted a seed of curiosity in my mind... Just what does a borisin beast ship taste like? I have been a chef for my whole life. There is no way that an ingredient challenge like this wouldn't get my heart racing.<br><br>A: So, I took the opportunity and asked what she knew. She said that she had discovered a lone beast ship in a system space close to the Xianzhou. This was strange as normally, wounded beast ships would be fed to the great mothership. However... this chance was one in a million. So, I accepted her three thousand strale deposit, and hired two armed archaeologists—<br><br>Q: (Interrupting) When you discovered the beast ship, why did you not report it to the Cloud Knights, and instead choose to privately hire outworlders to intercept and slaughter it?<br><br>A: When we found it, the energy storage organ in its chest had already begun to shrink. If this continued, it would start to abandon its aged and useless body parts and digest a number of its own organs like a lizard shedding its tail. We couldn't just let that happen!<br><br>Q: How does that affect you?<br><br>A: Well, if it ate them all itself, there'd be nothing left for us.<br><br>Q: ...What I mean is, why did you not report this to the Cloud Knights? You are an ex-service Cloud Knights veteran. You should be extremely aware of the relevant regulations and requirements.<br><br>A: If we reported this to the Cloud Knights, we'd barely get a helping of the beast ship meat once it was cooked. Plus, I quit service long ago. I am a cook now, not a Cloud Knight.<br><br>Q: ...Just continue with the story!<br><br>A: We ascertained from the swollen gland on its forehead that this was likely a lone servant ship. The combination of hunger and the pressure of the vacuum against its internal cavity had caused its toxins and fuel to solidify under compression. We arrived at the nearby location without taking any fire.<br><br>A: Although, as the saying goes: \"A hungry beast ship still weighs thirty thousand kilos.\" The void oar fins under it are not to be underestimated, either. Though they may look light and floaty, the jellyfish tentacle-like appendages extending from the tips of the oar fins are actually complex phase structures... If we had gotten entangled, they would have strangled the life out of our ship.<br><br>A: Worse still, if the energy storage tissue in these tentacles was broken, the reflux of biomass would have spread a foul, bile-like stench across the entire beast ship. In the end, we had no choice but to give up on landing on the tail and search for another landing point...<br><br>Q: Stop, stop. I don't need some pop-science lecture on beast ship biology. What did you do once you were inside?<br><br>A: Generally speaking, when preparing ingredients, you must take care not to damage the head. This is because the brain and the head meat are all extremely precious ingredients. However, the beast ship's control center is distributed through separate locations. Special attack ships even have up to ten brains. As long as one brain remains, it will be able to break off and become a new, separate beast ship to continue battle.<br><br>A: So, though I was reluctant to do it, I had them blow up the head in order to enter the ship through the receded nasal cavity in the center of the skull.<br><br>Q: Did you not encounter any danger once you were inside the beast ship?<br><br>A: Ugh, you have no idea. Once we entered through the skull, because the brains in the other regions were still alive, the immune system kicked off constantly until we took out the final brain. As we walked through the corridors, hands and tentacles would keep bursting through the writhing walls to grab us.<br><br>A: The energy supply organs in the abdomen gave us real trouble, too. Sarcomas in the body caused by the curse of the Plagues Author allows biological energy that has been created from thin air to be converted into other forms of energy. Logically speaking, this should have been the most rich and delicious region of the beast ship. However, this self-generated energy was not enough to make the ship self-sustaining. The corpses of devoured servants and various living organisms, accumulated toxic substances, and a huge amount of waste material that had not yet been moved to the excretion area had all amassed here. The disgusting scene almost wiped out the guild employees on sight.<br><br>Q: From what we understand of the Armed Archaeologists, when they encounter a situation like this, they are supposed to immediately destroy the beast ship's energy supplying organ. Was it you that stopped them?<br><br>A: Yes, I was furious at the time. Once a dying beast ship's internal circulation is cut, the biomass constantly generated inside the cabin would increase internal pressure endlessly. If it blew up, we'd simply become dregs of meat ourselves. What's more, with the exhaustion caused by hypothermia and the spasms of the abdomen... if the corridors and cabins collapsed, anyone inside would be crushed to death in the stomach.<br><br>Q: We discovered numerous concentrated high-frequency blade cuts around the propeller of the beast ship corpse. What did you do?<br><br>A: We removed the poisonous parts. Although, the actual propeller was likely destroyed in battle. The part you are talking about is likely a temporary substitute created from the redundant breeding cavity.<br><br>A: Because of this, it was located directly above the excretion area, making it convenient for extracting residual gene fragments as supplementary embryonic information for propagation, as well as being able to use accumulated waste material and save on fuel. However, due to the excessive operation of this newly-grown flesh, it had developed two contradictory properties of tenderness and strength. I could not bear to part with this meat, so... I had no choice but to cut off all the poisonous cysts one by one. (The culprit falls silent)<br><br>Q: I didn't tell you to stop, continue.<br><br>A: Sorry, I spaced out. The flavor of that meat. It was so unexpectedly... Average. Completely average."

It's not all bad though. It's a chance to toughen up the rookies. Honestly, the current batch of young crew members is softer than ever. None of them can handle hard work. They start whining about needing a break before we've even sailed a dozen light-years. And now, thanks to the sponsor's orders, we can't stop anywhere except at the IPC's internal asteroid supply stations during this journey. Those rookies are in for a rude awakening.<br><br>Log Date: Day 17 of Voyage<br>Recorded by: Captain Jayne Blakes<br>Cargo Status: Normal<br>Fuel Status: 54.9%<br>Supply Status: 66.0%<br>Route Status: Minor disturbances, no repairs needed<br><br>Today, I played cards with the IPC specialist and cleaned him out. He had to give me a bottle of Dragon Spring Brew to get his uniform back. He said it's a rare drink, and he wasn't kidding. I almost got drunk just from popping the bottle cap. *sigh* This route was supposed to take us through the Luofu. If it weren't for the sponsor's ridiculous demands, I would definitely have gone for a proper drink there.<br><br>Given all the secrecy, I asked the specialist what valuable thing we were transporting this time. He said it's the Guild's latest secret weapon designed specifically to take down the Antimatter Legion. Those nerds at the Guild always say that, but the items always end up getting smashed into scrap metal.<br><br>Log Date: Day 30 of Voyage<br>Recorded by: Captain Jayne Blakes<br>Cargo Status: Normal<br>Fuel Status: 21.1% remaining. Refueled at the asteroid supply station. Restored to 99.1%<br>Supply Status: 40.0% remaining. Resupplied at the asteroid supply station. Restored to 80.0%<br>Route Status: Moderate disturbances, lane correction completed<br><br>Even though this is a supply station, all we can get here is fuel and water. The only food available is these rock-hard compressed biscuits that even cockroaches can't bite into. And there's a limit on those, too. I've complained to HQ several times, but nothing ever changes.<br><br>What's even more frustrating is the IPC specialists traveling with us. Their fancy meals are served up like clockwork, complete with afternoon tea and sweet treats. And once they're fed, they lounge around, playing cards all day. I really don't get why IPC keeps these freeloaders around.<br><br>Log Date: Day 49 of Voyage<br>Recorded by: Captain Jayne Blakes<br>Cargo Status: Normal<br>Fuel Status: 49.7%<br>Supply Status: 42.0%<br>Route Status: Moderate disturbances, continuous lane correction underway<br><br>This is the roughest part of the voyage. We've run out of fresh food, and every last drop of booze is gone. My mouth felt as dry and bland as cardboard.<br><br>But what's even harder to get over is the mind-numbing boredom. Most sailors have nothing to do except patrol the cargo hold endlessly. Then, yesterday, things got spicy between a few sailors and the IPC specialists. It all started because the sailors heard strange noises from the cargo holds while on patrol. They wanted to open the cargo to check it out, but the specialists wouldn't let them. It turned into a heated argument. Luckily, I stepped in just in time to calm everyone down and prevent things from escalating.<br><br>The crew on the long-haul transport vessels often gets freaked out by all sorts of weird occurrences. Strange noises from inside crates, cryosleep pods shutting on their own, tentacle monsters hiding in the vents... The Guild always chalks it up to the organic brains being too prone to hallucinations. Sure, I've seen my fair share of spooky stuff, but it usually disappears if you ignore it. No need to freak out. The more you shrug it off, the quicker it goes away. These young bucks are still green. At the end of the day, we're just here to haul cargo, and getting the job done is what matters most.<br><br>Log Date: Day 64 of Voyage<br>Recorded by: Captain Jayne Blakes<br>Cargo Status: Normal<br>Fuel Status: 2.9%<br>Supply Status: 0.5%<br>Route Status: Abnormal. Forced to change lanes due to unforeseen circumstances, heading to the Xianzhou Luofu for resupply<br><br>When someone's luck goes sour, even simple tasks become challenging.<br><br>We encountered an attack by borisin, just a few light-years away from the Luofu. Our radar didn't catch their approach at all and they boarded us before our long-range weapons could even kick in. It was a dire situation. We were completely outmatched in close combat against borisin. Their razor-sharp teeth and claws could easily shatter human bones.<br><br>I ordered the sealing of all security doors and directed everyone to retreat to the central cargo hold. With my courageous leadership and strategic command, we successfully fended off borisin. They couldn't make any headway against us! While they were momentarily held back, I quickly sent out a distress signal.<br><br>In the end, a Xianzhou spaceship nearby spotted us. They swiftly approached and landed on the New Londinium, led by a young female swordmaster wielding a weapon taller than herself. Borisin stood no chance against her. At first, I thought they were Cloud Knights sent by the Luofu. But they introduced themselves as hailing from the Xianzhou Zhuming. Like all Xianzhou folks, they were dressed in peculiar attire...<br><br>Our spaceship suffered severe damage, with fuel and supplies nearly depleted. Its current condition doesn't support further travel. The Zhuming folks suggested we head to the Luofu for repairs. Despite strong opposition from the IPC specialists, I had no other option. As captain, I must prioritize the crew's safety, so I'm altering our course for the Luofu. As for the blasted cargo, all I can assert is that while the cargo belongs to the IPC, our lives are our own!<br><br>But wait... There was never any hint of borisin activity in the safety reports for this route before. It's weird. Why would they attack our ship?"

Discounting the potential turbulence, your voyage into the sea of memoria is sure to become a wonderful memory you'll never forget.<br><br>Each of the 12 Dreamscapes features different sceneries that you can appreciate while on the non-stop cruise circuit. To complement your tour experience, The Family has prepared this comprehensive guidebook for you to reference as you plan your journey.<br><br>The Moment of Midnight is the starting point of all dreams. People tend to overlook this moment, believing there's nothing beyond the inky darkness it presents. But if you were to stand along the side walls of the airship, close your eyes, and prick up your ears, you'd be able to hear chuckles and laughter from entering the dream, sounds tossed along waves and foams on the sea of memoria. These types of simple happiness are secrets that you can never buy at the Dreamscape Sales Store. Besides, if you give up on the silence of midnight, then you will also miss the stunning shock when the first ray of sunlight shines over the horizon the second the Radiant Feldspar enters the Moment of Serenity.<br><br>These waters are close to the boundaries of nightmares, so do not be alarmed by any sounds you may hear. The Radiant Feldspar is an absolutely safe facility! Rather than just taking in the views, why not take the time to bond with your friends over breakfast in the restaurant or cleanse your consciousness in the dream bubble spring?<br><br>On the Planet of Festivities, time everywhere is frozen for each specific moment. Only The Family, which protects the sweet dream, feels the turn of night and day along the cruise's path. When you finish breakfast, you'll be lucky enough to marvel at the Dewlight Pavilion, doused in morning dew. Since time immemorial, the pavilion has been the one to watch over the decline and rise of this planet. This is where the Origami Dreamweavers have chosen to place the start of a day, before progressing into Moment of Daybreak and Gilded Hour. Every sweatdrop that members of The Family have shed under the sun has come together to create an everlasting dream set against the night sky.<br><br>For confidentiality reasons, please respect the guidelines and only take photos within the suitable parameters when visiting the aforementioned domains.<br><br>Hunger doesn't hit when you're in your dreams. So, if you're fine with having lunch a little later, then head up to the port side deck on the Radiant Feldspar right when it strikes noon for a bird's eye view of Professor Glaux's final creation: The Paperfold University, where tons of Dreamweaver Engineers graduated from. Even the most eloquent of languages fail to describe its magnificence, one that easily puts the vast and mesmerizing sea of memoria to shame. Are you a fan of Himemia Films? If so, step right up to the starboard side of the deck to catch a glimpse of the mirage-like Penacony's Grand Museum beneath memoria. This museum was where they filmed the famous dream bubble movie, Fictional Wondernight.<br><br>Food is provided on the observation deck of the upper deck, with a spread ranging from fancy desserts to street snacks, so eat to your heart's content! No, really. Everything here is just part of the dream, so you won't end up overeating or getting cavities here.<br><br>Moments of Oasis and Scorchsand lie next to each other like two colorful ribbons. It's a pity you can no longer see them clearly now that they're clouded over by layers of fog following a meme incursion and repercussions from the recent Dreamscape turmoil. Even so, that doesn't mean your precious hours in the afternoon are going to waste! Choose to visit the art salon that opens occasionally in the meeting hall on the second floor, or drop by the restaurant and bar below the Captain's Quarters to see if you're in luck for a surprise.<br><br>The passage of time never fails to put one in a low mood. When songs begin to play and the sky starts to turn a fiery red, the Blue Hour steps in to complement this journey's mood. When the Radiant Feldspar cruises in the sky, the Eventide likewise meanders across the ocean floor. Eager and energetic tourists tend to crowd out the dance floor, so make sure you grab yourself a partner before the place turns into a tin of sardines. Whether it's your business partner or the other half you fought with, you'd never go wrong inviting them to a dance. By the time the blanket of twinkling stars finds its reflection in the sea like a gorgeous spread of gems unattended by anyone, you'll then find all feelings of frustration gone.<br><br>As for the final Golden Hour, I'll leave it up to your own eyes to take in the views."

Through their stories, this book wishes to unveil the secrets surrounding the mysterious luxury airship known as the Radiant Feldspar, and showcase the ship's importance in the history of Penacony.<br><br>Being able to cruise along the Sea of Dreams almost endlessly does not mean that the Sea of Dreams itself is tranquil and serene. Indeed, this writer once calculated the length of service of past captains, only to realize that these captains did not hold their positions for long. During the Radiant Feldspar's early days, ten consecutive captains had to step down as a result of injuries. This is even after The Family had, on numerous occasions, dispatched Dreamweaver teams to upgrade certain components of the Radiant Feldspar in the hope of ensuring her safety while cruising. Subsequent captains did not serve any longer as a result of these improvements. Some conspiracy theorists believe this to be related to the social status of guests aboard the airship. After all, having an extensive network of connections typically signifies huge profits are involved...<br><br>...<br>The First Captain: Danny, the Pioneer of Dreamweavers<br>The story of the Radiant Feldspar begins with a Dreamweaver from the Oak Family: Danny. Despite graduating from Paperfold University with stellar grades, Danny, who saw adventure as his true passion, did not continue to work as a Dreamweaver. Instead, he wandered along the border of Dreamscape and reality, searching tirelessly for a way to link the two worlds. It is said that the inspiration for building the Radiant Feldspar came from the first time he ventured deep into the dense fog of the sea of memoria, where he went on a wondrous adventure that felt nearly dream-like. To the creator and first-ever captain of the Radiant Feldspar, the luxurious airship was not only a bond that linked all of Penacony's Twelve Hours, but also a glorious achievement that showcased The Family's status.<br><br>Under Danny's command, the Radiant Feldspar completed her very first cruise. Departing from the Penacony Grand Theater, the Radiant Feldspar slowly embarked on her maiden cruise under Danny's leadership, becoming not only a source of pride for The Family, but ultimately a legend in the Cosmos itself. Danny's contributions toward the Radiant Feldspar did not lie with her design and construction alone. More importantly, with his extensive expeditionary experience, he also drew up the initial cruise route for this airship, officially marking the start of the Radiant Feldspar's storied tale.<br><br>2nd Captain: Amber, the Captain Who Weathered the Storm<br>Taking over the helm from Danny, the second captain of the Radiant Feldspar was Amber, an extraordinary lady from the Bloodhound Family. Under her leadership, the Radiant Feldspar not only successfully rode out Memory Zone storms time and again, but also discovered new cruise routes amid the tempests, thereby making significant contributions to the exploration of Penacony. Amber's control of the Radiant Feldspar was arguably perfect. Ensuring the safety of the airship and all the guests aboard her was all in a day's work for her, even in the most perilous of conditions.<br><br>Amber's admirable courage and resolve led her to become one of the most respected captains of the Radiant Feldspar across its storied history.<br><br>...<br><br>18th Captain: Gareth, the Morning Star<br>As the 18th captain of the Radiant Feldspar, Gareth was renowned for his in-depth understanding of the Sea of Dreams. Born to a Pepeshi family that sailed for a living for generation after generation, Gareth had always held boundless curiosity and passion toward sailing.<br><br>After assuming the position of captain, he brought revolutionary changes to the Radiant Feldspar's cruise routes. Under his guidance, the Radiant Feldspar could not only cruise at will along the Sea of Dreams, but also accurately determine the optimal route to the Twelve Hours. With this, the link between Penacony's Dreamscape and the planetary system of the outside world was tightened.<br><br>Gareth's contributions did not stop at just improving the Radiant Feldspar's cruise routes. Aboard the airship, he also established a miniature observation station that could be used to research the various bizarre phenomena witnessed in the Sea of Dreams. These studies not only improved understanding of memoria and the Sea of Dreams among academic circles, but they also significantly contributed to the development of Penaconian technology.<br><br>...<br><br>53rd Captain: Irina, the Guardian of the Dreamscape<br>Across the long history of the Radiant Feldspar, few understood the world of the Dreamscape as well as Irina did. Hailing from the Nightingale Family, Irina demonstrated a keen interest in the Dreamscape even as a child, often offering unique insights into the world. When she assumed the post of Radiant Feldspar captain, her foremost mission was to explore the Sea of Dreams for new cruising lanes, to replace old lanes that had since been blocked by Memory Zone storms.<br><br>The most commendable deed that Irina ever accomplished was the time when the Radiant Feldspar met with an accident. Irina's masterful control over Dreamweaving technology allowed her to successfully stabilize a cruising lane on the brink of collapse, thereby saving all the lives on deck. This feat not only proved her abilities as a captain, but it also demonstrated just how significant the contributions that Dreamweavers made toward Penacony were.<br><br>...<br><br>92nd Captain: Lukas, the Resonator of Melodies<br>Born a Halovian, Lukas was renowned for his passion for music and his genius that spurred a legend of a music concert aboard the Radiant Feldspar.<br><br>Lukas believed that music was the bridge that connected different lives and cultures, as well as the key to exploring the various planets. Under his leadership, the Radiant Feldspar was transformed into a floating palace of music. Each time a new guest boarded the airship, he would always organize a grand concert and invite musicians from different star systems to perform at the event. He used the power of music to astound esteemed guests who were arriving at Penacony for the first time to their very beings.<br><br>During an unprecedented concert, Lukas successfully used the resonance of music to transport the listeners to the Grand Theater, creating the most miraculous of viewing experiences at the theater across that performance season. This feat not only garnered him glory and honor of the highest degree, it also added another amazing chapter to the legendary story of the Radiant Feldspar."

I'm still sorting out the details, but long story short, I managed to coax some info out of a few airship staff members and local Penaconian celebrities on board. Check out the attached audio recording for proof. What I do know is that they're definitely gearing up for the opening of the Charmony Festival because the cast and crew are already doing rehearsals. Can't say for sure if it's really going to be held on the Radiant Feldspar, but judging from how things are looking, it's very likely.<br><br>As for why they rescheduled, there are many theories. Some say it's because of infighting within The Family, while others say it's because the IPC got involved. For the latter, the story goes that The Family wasn't keen on the IPC as their exclusive sponsor, and they were retaliated on before negotiations could finish. But the most interesting piece of news I heard alleges that it's because Robin got into trouble. Rumor has it that she intends to terminate her contract with The Family and transfer to the IPC, but The Family doesn't want to let her go.<br><br>What's more, I ran into some IPC workers on the airship, and I even heard that a good number of super high-ranking IPC leaders are here too. Other than that, I also got to talking to someone in-the-know. This person was supposed to be on marriage leave, but he was suddenly transferred to Penacony for official business. You don't kick up this much fuss for anyone but a star like Robin.<br><br>Attachment: Audio Recording-2392379451<br><br>Mail No. 4<br>From: Dahlia@GalaxyEntertainmentWeekly<br>To: Carl@GalaxyEntertainmentWeekly<br>Subject: Re: Intel - Charmony Festival's Shocking Truth<br>Carl, you should know that the IPC has been trying to reclaim Penacony for a long time now. Even if they were really there for Robin's contract, that would make it a business negotiation. If we were to publish anything on that, the IPC would sue our pants off.

Check if she's been slacking off or giving attitude to the staff. Better yet, snap a misleading photo of her looking like she messed up, and we can fluff up the word count and slap it on the front page alongside news of the new Charmony Festival rehearsals. Dig up some bigger scoops, and we'll do both front page and feature page. If that's not enough, we can even publish a standalone special edition!<br><br>One last reminder: Do not involve yourself in any of the IPC's business matters. The magazine doesn't want trouble!<br><br>Mail No. 5<br>From: Carl@GalaxyEntertainmentWeekly<br>To: Dahlia@GalaxyEntertainmentWeekly<br>Subject: Re: Re: Intel - Charmony Festival's Shocking Truth<br>I talked to some celebrities on the airship and got some new info. I now have a better idea of which topics to focus on. Here's a rundown:<br><br>First, a fashion designer mentioned that Robin didn't approach any brands for a haute couture gown. She's an insider, so she should've heard news about whether or not she's approached a local Penaconian brand, but there just wasn't any. It's possible for Robin to perform in a debuted gown, but that's not how things usually go.<br><br>Next, I spoke to a few socialites I know. The information I got from them was mostly trivial, but I sorted through them anyway.<br>To summarize, people are speculating that the Robin we see now might be a stand-in and not the real deal. They say that the real Robin has been canceled by The Family, and they are keeping her out of the limelight.<br><br>This came from fans who grew suspicious after Robin stopped making her usual public appearances for multiple days. The official website also stopped publishing any news about her. There were unofficial sources that reported sightings of her here and there, but none of them were backed up by solid proof. When the fans demanded answers from Robin's management team, the team uploaded a short clip of Robin in a rehearsal. However, when the fans compared the short with old photos, they noticed that her hands seemed slimmer than before. This made them suspect that the person in the clip was a stand-in. After all, you can change someone's facial appearance through plastic surgery, but not the bone structure of their limbs. It's just not possible.<br><br>Her face also appears to be puffier than usual. More importantly, though, the feathers on her Halovian wings look especially stiff. When they did a frame-by-frame comparison of the video, they noticed that the feathers didn't even move! This made them suspect that it was just a prop. Either way, everyone thinks she looks kind of gaunt and has lost some of her idol charm. Still, didn't they release that video at this time just to appease suspicions? It just gets stranger and stranger. It feels like they hired a stand-in to gloss things over, but we aren't fools. They're just making it more obvious that something is wrong.<br><br>I've recently obtained the fan's frame-by-frame screenshots and video footage. There might actually be something to this rumor. I've chucked them all into the attachment so you can look for yourself!<br><br>Attachment: Robin Video Frame-by-Frame Comparison Package<br><br>Mail No. 6<br>From: Dahlia@GalaxyEntertainmentWeekly<br>To: Carl@GalaxyEntertainmentWeekly<br>Subject: Re: Re: Re: Intel - Charmony Festival's Shocking Truth<br>Niiice!<br><br>I've done the layout and left you enough space on the feature page and even thought of the headline for you. Let's call this article series \"Where's Robin?\"!<br><br>The Charmony Festival is too serious a topic. Many readers will only take a few quick glances to see if the festival's still happening, but if they see news of a celebrity getting into trouble, that's the kind of stuff they'll bite! Considering how popular Robin is, you should contact her fans and arrange an interview. Let the fans express their needs and then press The Family for an explanation. If The Family actually responds, we'll publish their statement in the next issue. Our magazines will totally fly off the shelves!"

                "Desc": "In a survey of the history of Penacony airship design, the Radiant Feldspar stands out among its peers. Not only does it represent the pinnacle of airship design technology, but it is also the perfect marriage of dreamweaving aesthetics and The Family's vision. The challenge the Dreamweavers faced was finding a way to merge ultimate luxury with practical airship design to build an airship that could handle Dreamscape exploration while providing unrivaled comfort. In this chapter, we shall discuss in-depth the dreamweaving philosophies behind the Radiant Feldspar and explore how it became the paragon of Penacony airship design.<br><br>Background<br>The initial concept for the Radiant Feldspar originated from an internal discussion among members of the Penaconian Family. At the time, many Dreamweavers found that the functionality and comfort levels of existing airships left a great deal to be desired. They wanted an airship that could perfectly incorporate functionality, luxury, technology, and artistry in one. This idea quickly received the support of the then-head of The Family, successfully kick-starting the Radiant Feldspar design and construction project.<br><br>The design team faced many challenges in the early stages of the project. These included having to explore different ways of incorporating the most advanced Dreamscape technology into the airship so that guests may freely travel between the Dreamscape's Twelve Hours via the airship, designing an appearance that conformed to the laws of aerodynamics yet also embodied luxury and beauty, and creating enough comfortable high-end facilities within the limited space available. However, through tireless work and innovation, the design team eventually overcame all difficulties and constructed this one-of-a-kind airship.<br><br>Airship Technology<br>The Radiant Feldspar adopted the use of many revolutionary technologies, with the most striking among them being its propulsion system. Unfortunately, as this system is one of The Family's proprietary trade secrets, we are not privy to its inner workings. Based on publicly available information, however, what we do know is that it only requires a very low maintenance cost to keep the system running. Just a handful of qualified Dreamweavers would be enough for daily operations.<br><br>Apart from its propulsion system, the Radiant Feldspar also boasts a state-of-the-art climate control system. The Dreamweavers are able to automatically regulate climate and atmosphere within the ship to suit guests' needs and accommodate external environmental changes. No matter the conditions outside the ship, the environment within is always pleasant and comfortable.<br><br>Design Philosophy<br>The Radiant Feldspar's design philosophy started from a simple vision: To build an airship capable of eternally cruising the skies above the Sea of Dreams and traveling freely between the Twelve Hours of Penacony, in addition to providing a premium experience for all guests on board. To make this vision a reality, the founding team employed many innovative technologies and materials to ensure flawless airship functionality and memorable visual and sensory experiences for guests.<br><br>Exterior Design<br>The inspiration for the design of the Radiant Feldspar's exterior came from two Penaconian elements: The splendorous Dreamscape, and the misty sea of memoria. The airship's streamlined outer frame is built with a special reflective material that casts dazzling lights upon the sea of memoria. This material is not only exceptionally robust but also boasts self-mending capabilities, allowing it to withstand corrosion by unstable memoria.<br><br>Interior Layout<br>The Radiant Feldspar's interior design breaks the mold of traditional airship layouts by utilizing an open space concept, cleverly merging lounges, entertainment facilities, and operational zones all into one cohesive space. From the spacious observation deck all the way to the luxurious lounge, every zone is designed to provide a first-rate experience for guests, epitomized in the way every detail reflects a dedication to the pursuit of comfort and aesthetics.<br><br>Service Philosophy<br>Every facility and service on board the Radiant Feldspar is designed to elevate the guest experience. The lavish interior decorations of the airship, from her spacious observation deck to the private screening rooms, all reflect the Penaconian approach to luxury. Guests are free to choose whether to spend their day in the restaurant dining on delicacies from various star systems, swim in the dream bubble pool on the deck, or marvel at the magnificent view of Penacony from the observation deck.<br><br>The Radiant Feldspar's service crew comprises the finest staff hand-picked by The Family after a competitive interviewing process. They are on standby every hour of the day, ready to fulfill a guest's every request on demand. From providing a private butler service, drafting a custom travel itinerary, to giving a guided tour of Penacony, the Radiant Feldspar service crew is always there to attend to your every need, a demonstration of their commitment to guaranteeing a unique experience for every guest that comes on board.<br><br>Influence<br>The Radiant Feldspar not only demonstrates her designers' ultimate pursuit of state-of-the-art technology and modern aesthetics, but it also introduces a new concept to the world: Luxury and functionality can co-exist. The Radiant Feldspar has no doubt redefined the standard for airship design and in so doing, unlocked new inspiration and challenges for future Dreamweavers.<br><br>The design and construction of the Radiant Feldspar was a grand project that spanned decades. More than just the amalgamation of Penacony's finest Dreamweaving technology and artistry, it also showcases The Family's insightful understanding of what the future of airship development could be.<br><br>The success of the Radiant Feldspar has set new standards in airship design and service philosophy. As a dreamweaving technology marvel, the embodiment of Penacony's vision for the future, and the epitome of the Penaconian desire to pursue their dreams, the Radiant Feldspar has penned a groundbreaking chapter in the history of airship design not just in Penacony but across the entire Cosmos. In addition to bearing witness to the fusion of dreams and technology, she has also become the symbol of many Penaconians' hopes for the future. As the Radiant Feldspar continues her journey, her legacy will surely inspire many more to chase their dreams, explore the unknown, and create an exciting future together."

                "Desc": "This Issue's Guest Columnist: Kenny<br><i>A passionate travel writer and photographer, Kenny began writing full-time after toiling away in the media industry for decades. Representative works: The Eternal Radiant Feldspar, Taste of Luofu</i><br><br>Boarding the Radiant Feldspar again was like reliving an old dream. Five years ago, I was invited by chance to the Radiant Feldspar, where I met my wife. She and I are separated now, so returning to this airship once filled with fond memories of love unavoidably stirs up complicated emotions in me. When a friend from Alfalfa learned of my predicament, they invited me to stay on board for a while to have some fun and take my mind off things. As a travel writer, I then decided I would wield my pen and record my full experiences here.<br><br>For regulars and new readers unfamiliar with the prestige of the Radiant Feldspar, allow me to explain: The Radiant Feldspar is no ordinary luxury cruise. She sails the skies of Penacony, shining bright as the most brilliant gem among The Family's countless treasures. As far as I know, not only is guest access to the airship invite-only, but invitations are also granted based on a secretive set of criteria. Rumor has it that only celebrities are extended invitations.<br><br>I've boarded many luxury cruises and starships over the years. Even so, I can safely say that none in the world can compare to the Radiant Feldspar.<br><br>It was already late at night when I boarded the small vessel that would ferry me to the Radiant Feldspar. By the time I stepped foot on deck in the middle of the night, the faint glow of stars was the only light I had to see by. Looking overboard into the depths below, a sea of floating clouds greeted my eyes. I was so very tired by then, but there was no way that I was going to miss out on such breathtaking sights.<br><br>I'm a regular when it comes to long-distance travel, and this trip didn't pose anything more than the usual challenges. The biggest crux was no doubt physical discomfort — there was simply no avoiding the edema that came with atmospheric pressure shifts. Much to my chagrin, however, it was bad enough this time that I couldn't even take off my boots... Hִow very embarrassing. A soothing massage sounded divine at this point, but it was late night... What were the chances that someone would be staffing the spa? To my surprise, an attendant informed me that the staff work in shifts on board. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, facilities are open round the clock. It was literally music to my ears. Dropping my luggage at record speed, I made a beeline for the spa for a much-needed massage.<br><br>I'm no expert on the history of Penacony's art of massage, but what I can say with certainty is that Penaconian massage therapists are true professionals. Upon assessing my condition, the lead therapist determined that I was in no condition for a full body massage, instead arranging for a \"dry brushing\" session for me. The room they prepared was stocked with uniquely scented essential oils, notably collaboration products with the well-known local beverage brand, SoulGlad. The oils absorbed easily into the skin, the process feeling as invigorating as an ice-cold bottle of SoulGlad on a hot day. After letting the oil soak in, they used a pair of exfoliating gloves to dry brush my body, kneading their way from my heels up to my calves. A mere few minutes later, the swelling had already gone down. Magic!<br><br>Suppose you think life on board the Radiant Feldspar is only about Penacony's sights. In that case, you'd no doubt overlook where her true charm lies: All those seemingly insignificant — yet undeniably precious — everyday moments. The Radiant Feldspar isn't just a luxury airship sailing above the clouds of Penacony. No, it's hearth and home with many a story to tell.<br><br>I returned to my room a happy traveler and slept soundly through the night. By then, the attentive attendants had already delivered my luggage to the room, even laying out the sundries with meticulous care. Haha, I don't even get such treatment back home, I must say.<br><br>The next morning, I was awakened by the faint sound of rhythmic running water arranged into a melodious tune outside my cabin. Later, I learned that this was the \"wake-up call\" service I had requested. Having grown up in a small agricultural town where farmers also started their day hearing such sounds, the wake-up call not only served its purpose of rousing me but also brought back fond memories of childhood. Honestly, it was done in such a natural and personalized manner that it's hard to fathom how they even pulled it off.<br><br>When I stepped outside, I saw Thomas — an elderly mechanic of the airship — giving the Radiant Feldspar's outdoor furniture a \"shower\" with his peculiar high-pressure water gun. This was exactly what the old farmers loved doing back home too: Using their high-pressure water guns to hose down everything from furniture to even their own coats. It was doubtless a comedic yet especially heartwarming moment for me.<br><br>When the attendant spotted me, they enthusiastically guided me to the restaurant for my first feast of the day: Breakfast (or should I say, lunch). When I caught a whiff of the aroma wafting from the kitchen, it instantly conjured up pleasant memories of freshly made bread and cheese at the markets in my homeworld. Much like the farmers back home, Mary, my personal chef, is also a lady highly particular about ingredients and taste. She, along with several others, works miracles in this kitchen above the clouds. Indeed, one could hardly believe that every single table here has the privilege of having a personal chef cater specially to them. I even found out later that all the chefs on board were well-known cooks recruited from various worlds. Through their exceptional culinary skills, they blend flavors from different planetary cuisines, creating unforgettable gastronomic experiences for diners. That said, I still much prefer Penacony's local fare, their signature dish.<br><br>After breakfast, I decided to explore the deck. There are all sorts of rooms on board the airship, ranging from lounges to chess rooms. I was confident that I would find inspiration for a new book here if I so wished.<br><br>After enjoying a good meal and a nice stroll, I huddled up on a sofa in the lounge to indulge in a book. It was then that an attendant approached me to inquire if I would like to attend the concert that would be held in the evening. I agreed right away, expecting it to be like any other concert, not unlike the piano performance during breakfast. It was only when night fell that I realized just how much I've underestimated the Radiant Feldspar...<br><br>In the next issue, I shall regale you with the tale of an enchanting concert. In the meantime, guess who I met there?<br><br><i>*</i>Holidays in Vogue<i> is published on the first of every month. Stay tuned for more!*</i>"

                "Desc": "Dear Miss Nun,<br><br>I'm so happy to have received your letter.<br><br>First, I must say you surprised me. I may be somewhat famous, but my readers much prefer reading my Night Fever adventure series.<br><br>Yet you — not only did you enjoy my rather immature ghost stories, you were able to perfectly capture the hidden meanings and emotions I tried to convey. I'll be frank — nothing would bring me more joy than this!<br><br>It may be strange to open up to a stranger, but for some reason, I'm happy to speak freely when I write to you. It's just as you surmised: I'm obsessed with observing how terror and despair leave marks on the human psyche. I'm intoxicated by the breathtaking beauty of once-vibrant life withering away like a wilting flower. It's not a hobby I can speak of in regular company, but I have no intention of hiding it from you.<br><br>And you're right, I have been in Penacony for a while. I originally came here to resolve a personal matter. As a fellow loyal fan of Mr. Edgar, I'm sure you also understand my initial disdain for this \"artificial dreamland\" and its pale imitation of reality. Yet, when I finally arrived in Penacony, I found myself increasingly drawn to the Dreamscape's dazzling splendor, and thus I've remained here till now.<br><br>I've chatted with people on the streets and reaped a wealth of information beyond what my dozens of bookshelves at home offered me. I've learned of local customs from thousands of planets and numerous bizarre ghost stories from different corners of the universe... Of course, the most fascinating subject is still the Dreamscape itself. Here I'll share with you the results of my investigations:<br><br>The first thing that caught my attention were stories about a \"memetic\" monster. It's said that it can take away the souls of humans while they're dreaming. The bodies of its victims would then enter a state of dormancy in reality, unable to be awakened.<br><br>By the time I started my investigation, there were already many such cases in Penacony. According to a Dreamweaver, the victims who were suddenly abducted were taken from different Dreamscape moments, were of different races, and had different behavior patterns. However, I believe there's still a logic to the meme's behavior.<br><br>Another point worth noting is most of the witnesses have had their memories related to the cases erased by The Family. Thus, I have reason to believe that the monster is related to The Family. At the very least, The Family must know of its existence and may have already taken or are taking measures to deal with it.<br><br>Not long after that, I lost contact with that Dreamweaver. Then at some point, the cases suddenly happened a lot less frequently, and I couldn't gather any more useful information.<br><br>However, soon after that, two incidents would become a turning point for my investigation.<br><br>The first is the emergence of an urban legend involving a strange Dream Ticker and a corrupted tape. It describes a peculiar nightmare and a scribbled note that insists The Family's beautiful dream is nothing but a lie and conspiracy. I looked into this incident and finally found more information from an eyewitness.<br><br>The second is another Dreamweaver's analysis on the structure of the Dreamscape. According to him, the sweet dreams only take up a small portion of Penacony's Dreamscape. The rest of it is an undeveloped chaotic wasteland. He also said the process of constructing the \"artificial dreamland\" tends to give birth to \"highly concentrated and extremely dangerous small-scale Nightmares.\" They tend to attach to the borders of the sweet dream and are used to collect and destroy negative emotions.<br><br>While The Family always insists that the sweet dream is safe, their insistence only ever applies to \"the sweet dream.\" Once I combined these two clues, my conclusions — or rather, speculations — are as follows:<br><br>First, the urban legend about Tickers is likely related to these \"artificial nightmares.\"<br><br>Second, the memes likely come from nightmares, or from a much deeper layer known as the Primordial Dreamscape. Personally, I think the latter is more likely to be true.<br><br>I will continue my investigation, but the clues I can now find are too scarce. I fear I won't be able to make much progress.<br><br>Regardless, I'm satisfied with my results so far. I've decided to use this as the theme of my next novel. Perhaps you can help provide me with some fascinating insights?<br><br>Looking forward to your reply — <br>Yours truly, Claudia"

This time, let's dive into the masses, and sniff out all the dirty little secrets everyone has been dying to know!<br><br>It's a well-known fact that the bustling streets of Penacony, a celebrity hotspot, are a true melting pot. From the tall and short to the plump and slender, and from the rich and poor to humans and non-humans, you can literally find all kinds of folks here. Among them, I bet those Halovians who shine like superstars pique the curiosity of many of you! Well, for The Laughter, I'm ready to snag you some exclusive street interviews at the risk of being chased by the Bloodhounds!<br><br>Well then, let's cut to the chase and grab a few unsuspecting passersby... Ahem, lucky interviewees, I mean.<br><br><b>Q1: Are those circular thingies above the Halovians' small heads tangible?</b><br><br>Grumpy Halovian: It's not some \"circular thingy\"! Sheesh, it's a halo! A halo, capeesh!?<br>Curious Foxian: Yep, it's tangible. I managed to touch it when he wasn't looking. Cool and smooth to the touch, the texture is amazing! Though, the beating I got afterward wasn't so great.<br>Mentally Stable Intellitron: It's a universally acknowledged fact that there are three things one should never touch: A Foxian's tail, a Pepeshi's fluff ball, and a Halovian's halo. So, basically, you were asking for a beating.<br><br><b>Q2: What happens if a Halovian's halo were to get stuck in something while they are walking?</b><br><br>\"Halo Researcher\": To begin with, according to my observations, the Halovians' halos in the physical realm do not have a tangible form. They are condensed energy projections that can even flicker during emotional disturbances or when telepathy is used. There is no concern about a halo becoming stuck.<br>\"Halo Researcher\": Furthermore, upon entering the Dreamscape, while it's true that the energy halo transforms into a physical entity under the influence of memoria, its position can be adjusted at will while within the dream, much like adjusting a hat. So, there's really no need for concern.<br>\"Halo Researcher\": Additionally, it is believed that all Halovians only have a basic circle when they are born. As they age, the halo evolves into various shapes reflecting their experiences and personality traits. Some special Halovians can even transform their halo into any shape they desire!<br>\"Halo Researcher\": Finally, all information mentioned is sourced from <i>Dreamchaser Bulletin: Urban Myth Edition</i>. Any similarities are purely coincidental, and I hold no responsibility for such occurrences.<br><br><b>Q3: What's the story behind the Halovians' telepathy?</b><br><br>Tabloid Reporter: Ah, you've asked the right person! Let me tell you, I'm one of the few people in Penacony who know a lot about the Halovians.<br>Tabloid Reporter: Here's the scoop. All Halovians can read minds, so you should take care when speaking with one. Thankfully, the range of their ability isn't that big and usually won't work more than 6–10 feet away, so just stand at a distance, and you'll be fine.<br>Tabloid Reporter: Halovians can also use their telepathy to communicate with one another without speaking. That's so much better than the communicators we have in the market now.<br>Tabloid Reporter: Also, Halovians with strong powers of Harmony can use their singing and language to manipulate others! It's said some Halovian Pathstriders can even unleash psychic attacks to stun a person or reduce their intelligence to zero!<br>Tabloid Reporter: What do you think? Interesting, right? I have more where that came from. If you'd like to know more, just transfer me 9,998 Alfalfa credits and...<br><br>That's a wrap for this issue! Stay tuned for more fresh scoops coming your way!"

The fluff ball on the heads of the Pepeshi is actually their core, while their human body is merely a form of mimicry.<br>2. Xipe once attempted to bestow blessings upon the Pepeshi, only to discover that it was Xipe THEMSELF who received the blessings.<br>3. Touching the Pepeshi's fluff ball can extend one's lifespan.<br>4. In times of danger, the Pepeshi's fluffy ball has the ability to detach from their body and regenerate a new body.<br>5. However, there are no known threats that are capable of making the Pepeshi feel truly endangered.<br>6. The Destruction is merely a derivative of the Pepeshi's one and only Path — Mischief.<br>7. The Pepeshi's fluff ball can emit faster-than-light particle beams.<br>8. The Pepeshi can catch the faster-than-light particle beams they launch at the end of those beams.<br>9. The Pepeshi do not dream. Instead, dreams dream of the Pepeshi.<br>10. Once, a Pepeshi told a joke in a restaurant at the end of the universe, leading to the emergence of Aha.<br>11. Pepeshi mathematicians have discovered the ultimate answers to all questions about life, the universe itself, and everything. However, there is not enough space in Penacony's Dreamscape to embrace the profound answers.<br>12. The first black hole was created when a Pepeshi forgot to limit their strength while arm-wrestling with a star.<br>13. Originally, there were several hundred Lord Ravagers until they unfortunately ran into a Pepeshi during a group excursion.<br>14. All the Pepeshi are actually a Pepeshi Deity's projections in the lower dimension.<br>15. When the Pepeshi want some hot water, the water heats itself.<br>16. The great hole in Penacony was actually formed when a Pepeshi punched the Dreamscape.<br>17. IPC initially intended to publicize the truth stated in Article 16, but that Pepeshi expressed their dissatisfaction, leading to an immediate change of plans.<br>18. When death approaches a Pepeshi, people will say \"death is approached by a Pepeshi.\"<br>19. The Aeon of Abundance possesses nearly infinite life, and the only time THEY came close to death was when the Aeon disturbed a Pepeshi during their nap.<br>20. Yaoshi borrowed THEIR lifespan from the Pepeshi. Lan purchased THEIR bow from the Pepeshi. Nous was actually crafted by the Pepeshi. Aha took THEIR jokes from the Pepeshi, and all of Xipe's music was composed by the Pepeshi.<br>21. The Pepeshi create Alfalfa credit by punching the money printing machines.<br>22. The Pepeshi never visit barbershops: They use plasma cannons to groom their fluff ball.<br>23. The Cancer of All Worlds is merely crumbs left behind by the Pepeshi during picnics throughout the universe.<br>24. The engine of the Trailblaze draws inspiration from the faster-than-light strides used by the Pepeshi during their leisurely strolls.<br>25. Clockie was originally based on a Pepeshi, but the camera capturing its image exploded in awe.<br>26. The Watchmaker is a Pepeshi who prefers to remain hidden from public view.

This serves as a warning to emphasize the importance of adhering to the rules.<br><br>1. The Issah Brawl Incident.<br><br>During the 20th Festivity Auditions, a participant named Issah experienced verbal attacks from the judges during his performance. Consequently, he abruptly left the stage and initiated a brawl with the judges. Furthermore, utilizing his talent for voice mimicry, Issah imitated the voices of the judges, provoking other participants and leading to a chaotic brawl involving almost 10 other infuriated contestants. They all showed their capacities and the disruption even extended into neighboring competition areas.<br><br>The turmoil persisted for around half a system hour, during which three security personnel from the Bloodhound Family intervened to restore order but sustained injuries of varying degrees.<br><br>Please note that if the judges display any inappropriate behaviors during the competition, it is crucial to promptly report it to the organizers instead of attempting to resolve the issue independently.<br><br>2. The Irksome Family Incident.<br><br>During the 6th Festivity Auditions, an unidentified participant impersonated Fowler, the head of the Iris Family at the time. This individual made derogatory remarks during a live broadcast of the audition, including statements such as \"We shall rename ourselves the Irksome Family,\" \"Anyone who dislikes the Irksome Family lacks taste,\" and \"I'm the most irksome of all.\" These actions significantly damaged the reputation of the Iris Family.<br><br>The impersonator left the scene before security Hounds arrived. The broadcast triggered a wave of parody among the Penaconian youth, with young people taking to the streets and chanting \"Irksome Family is the best of all!\" as a means of criticizing Fowler's conservative cultural beliefs.<br><br>Please note that any form of role-playing, particularly parodies involving official members of The Family, IPC, and Xianzhou Alliance, is strictly prohibited.<br><br>3. The Airbag Cannonball Incident.<br><br>During the 11th Festivity Auditions, a participant named Angus concealed eight highly compressed airbags within his clown suit as a promotional stunt for his company's fast food products. His plan was to leap into the air and release the safety valves to display the product's advertising slogan as the bags expand and fly off. However, during the performance, five of the airbags malfunctioned due to poor quality, and one of the remaining three leaked due to a sharp accessory on his clown suit. When the safety valves were activated, Angus was propelled into the SoulGlad bottle on site like a cannonball and became stuck in the bottleneck.<br><br>By the time Agnus was freed, he was foaming at the mouth.<br><br>Please note that unconventional attire is not encouraged. Any attire that violates the dress code must undergo inspection by the organizers before the wearer is allowed to enter the venue.<br><br>...<br><br>80. The Man-Eating Meme Incident.<br><br>During the 12th Festivity Auditions, a participant named Buzzy brought a meme disguised as a human onto the stage and announced a \"man-eating show\" to the audience during the live broadcast. Before the judges could intervene, the scene of the meme seemingly consuming Buzzy alive spread throughout Penacony via the live broadcast, leaving a lasting psychological impact on an entire generation of adolescents. Although Buzzy managed to escape from the meme's grasp by the end of the show, the incident had a significantly negative impact.<br><br>The intense fear sparked by the man-eating show attracted an extremely dangerous Memory Zone Meme, and it was only through the intervention of Don Wyatt, the head of the Bloodhound Family, that the lethal entity was destroyed.<br><br>Please note that it is strictly prohibited to bring Memory Zone Memes onto the stage. Neither wild nor domesticated memes are allowed to enter the venue."

The wine at the end of the world is reserved for Fools, while even Geniuses struggle to obtain Yu Qingtu's finest wine... However, SoulGlad belongs to all beings in the universe! It is loved by everyone and accessible to all!<br>— Mr. Aideen, Father of SoulGlad</i><br><br>SoulGlad, the reigning king of soft drinks in the universe, stands as the most commercially successful brand in Penacony. It has changed Penacony, revolutionized dietary habits in thousands of worlds, and reshaped the entire beverage market across the universe. However, this grand business empire was actually established in the humble kitchen of a desolate prison...<br><br>During 2148 AE, an IPC ship landed on the ring-shaped prison of the Asdana system, breaking the long-standing silence.<br><br>Ever since the calamity caused by the Destruction disrupted interstellar routes, the prison, constructed by the IPC, had not seen any outsiders for a long time. All the prisoners working outside the building suspended their labor and observed the arrival of the visitors.<br><br>A group of people in black IPC uniforms stepped out from the ship. They were IPC employees recruited from neighboring star systems. Most of them possessed an imposing stature and intimidating looks, serving as a deterrent against the prisoners. However, behind them stood a small, slender man who seemed out of place. He wore a clean white uniform, fluffy hair, thick lenses reflecting wisdom, and a kind smile beneath his mustache.<br><br>People referred to him as Mr. Sousa, the new head chef for this prison. His culinary expertise once shone at the Galactic Culinary Contest. He had previously worked in the most esteemed restaurant in Pier Point and was rumored to have lured the beasts of Voracity with his dishes. Everyone pondered why such a remarkable man would visit such a remote and abandoned prison, but only he knew the answer: For his devotion.<br><br>He followed the guards through the prison gates, basked in the resentful glances from the prisoners. All the prisoners here had been wanted criminals who ended up here as a consequence of obstructing the IPC's interests. The inhumane conditions of the prison had taken a heavy toll on them, and they anticipated that these unfamiliar faces would bring more suffering in the future.<br><br>\"O, the Great One above! Look at my poor 'family members'! I will bring you salvation!\"<br><br>Before the guards could assert their authority over the prisoners, Mr. Sousa ran up to the inmates, signing with a worried look on his face.<br><br>Poor? Family? Salvation? To the prisoners, those words were unheard of. While the guards couldn't help but burst out laughing, the prisoners perceived it as humiliation. Nobody expressed gratitude towards Mr. Sousa's kindness, but rather they felt the new chef was trampling on what little dignity they had left.<br><br>They silently agreed that they must teach this arrogant chef a lesson!<br><br>They meticulously planned how to \"accidentally\" knock over the porridge bucket beside him or \"accidentally\" snap a dish in his face, or even \"inadvertently\" make him bathe in hot soup...<br><br>However, when they saw the carefully prepared dinner, everyone forgot about their elaborate plans.<br><br>The dirty plates were full of delectable dishes and the rusty porridge bucket smelled delicious. None of the prisoners could believe their eyes. They never dreamed that the decaying meat and rotten vegetables from the prison's warehouses could be made into such magnificent creations.<br><br>Overnight, Mr. Sousa became an adored figure among the prisoners. His intention had simply been to improve their lives, unaware that he was on the brink of creating a miracle that would ripple across the universe...<br><br>Witnessing Mr. Sousa's exceptional culinary skills, the prisoners let go of their animosity and quickly formed bonds with this kind-hearted man. Through their stories, Mr. Sousa learned about the injustices inflicted by the IPC. Many of the prisoners had been wrongfully imprisoned, enduring abuse and torment at the hands of their prison guards. They were not only physically confined but also deprived of the simple pleasures that could nourish their souls.<br><br>Determined to alleviate their suffering, Mr. Sousa pondered how to bring joy back into their lives. Drawing upon his extensive knowledge, he created a special spice from scarce ingredients and fashioned a sweet drink around it.<br><br>However, a mere sweet drink was insufficient to ease the prisoners' physical and mental anguish.<br><br>During his explorations across the Asdana system in his spare time, Mr. Sousa stumbled upon a miraculous herb known as \"Dreamleaf.\" This herb possessed the power to heal the prisoners' emotions, alleviating their depression caused by hunger and fatigue, and granting them peaceful and blissful dreams at night.<br><br>Incorporating this extraordinary herb into his drink's formula, along with the addition of exhilarating bubbles, Mr. Sousa created the legendary beverage known as \"SoulGlad.\"<br><br>The prisoners soon fell in love with this delightful elixir, as it washed away their pain and animosity as long as they drank it. Mr. Sousa discreetly shared SoulGlad with the prison guards as well, fostering a sense of unity as they savored the joy alongside the prisoners. It was a realization of his vision for Harmony, a dream encapsulated within a bottle.<br><br>Mr. Sousa firmly believed that this tantalizing beverage could resolve conflicts not only within the prison but also throughout the entire universe. His dream was for all cosmic beings to on day gather around a table, setting aside disputes and hatred, and joyfully enjoying SoulGlad while singing the Ode to Harmony.<br><br>As for how IPC suppressed Mr. Sousa's good deeds in the future, how Mr. Sousa made SoulGlad the cornerstone on which Penacony was built, and how Mr. Aideen transformed the declining SoulGlad into a renowned brand across the stars... those are stories for another day."

Groggily, he opens his eyes and draws the curtains, his mind still heavy with sleep. Outside, a flurry of origami birds scrambles in the air as a shower of stones cascades down from the sky like rain.<br><br>\"Tweet, Clockie, Clockie! You're finally awake! Come out, come out. We need your help with something important.\"<br>\"Tick-tock, but if I step outside, those stones will definitely smash my head.\"<br>\"Chiro! Nope, you silly! Those stones are us repairing the houses. You're my dear friend, Clockie, and my stones will only smash Boss Stone's head.\"<br><br>Boss Stone. The very mention of the name brings a sudden clarity to Clockie's sleepy mind.<br>The stones used to construct Dreamville are actually the most precious gems in the world. Origami birds carefully collected them from the desert and forest to construct the town, the home of their friends, piece by piece. That's why Boss Stone constantly brings lots of baddies here to rob the birds of their precious gems and wreak havoc in the town.<br><br>Clockie steps out of the door cautiously. Just as the origami bird said, all the stones fall around the house, avoiding his dial.<br><br>\"Tick-tock, the clever and brave Clockie is coming, my friends! I can resolve any trouble that comes our way.\"<br>\"Oh, clever Clockie, the stones in Dreamville have almost run out.\"<br>\"And if we don't find more stones soon, we'll have to live in dilapidated houses.\"<br><br>Clockie realizes the gravity of the situation. Living in crumbling dwellings would mean rain can soak into his dial, and he would definitely rust! But the birds are struggling to find more stones when they are flying so high already. How is Clockie supposed to find these stones?<br><br>\"I know of a place, Clockie.\"<br><br>The one who speaks is Captain Revolver, Clockie's dear friend and an old crew member of The Compass. This courageous and formidable hero has helped Clockie out of trouble countless times. With a head shaped like a giant revolver with an old cowboy hat sitting on it, he always instilled fear into the hearts of baddies.<br><br>\"Remember the caves in the forest? Those dark tunnels connect countless towns and forests.\"<br>\"Tick-tock. I get you, Captain.\"<br><br>The caves hold countless treasures and innumerable dangers, but with Captain Revolver leading the way, Clockie feels no fear. The Captain's aim is always true, and with a single shot, he can vanquish any foe. Together, they will find a new forest, bring back stones, and Dreamville will become even more beautiful.<br><br>However, a new challenge soon emerges, causing Clockie's hour hand to twitch in frustration.<br><br>\"Tick-tock, but the caves are too dark. How are we supposed to find our way through?\"<br>\"Don't worry, Clockie. The tunnels are home to many luminous butterflies. They're all my friends. Time waits for no one. Let's embark on this adventure right now, just like the old days.\"<br>\"Yeah, let's go!\"<br><br>Captain Revolver, known for his fiery temperament, leads the way with brisk strides. That's why he's always leading the group, with a few origami birds trailing behind him. These clever helpers know exactly which stones will be suitable for the town. The still-drowsy Clockie walks at a leisurely pace, bringing up the rear of the group.<br><br>This is how our intrepid band of adventurers embark on their journey."

Glad to meet you!\"<br>\"Origami birds! I heard you've eaten up all the fruits belonging to Missy Fruit Tree. You won't eat us, right?\"<br><br>Just as they step into the tunnel, the butterflies start to chat incessantly. Their delicate wings flutter and flap, illuminating the path ahead in blinking lights. Clockie cannot help but marvel at how lovely these new friends are.<br><br>The complicated tunnels resemble a giant labyrinth. Even the butterflies only dare to live near the entrance. But, with Captain Revolver taking the lead, they have found the courage to venture deeper.<br><br>\"Tick-tock, how spacious it is here! If only Dreamville could be as grand.\"<br>\"Once we discover a new forest, not even a hundred tunnels like this can compare to our town.\"<br><br>\"A town as large as a hundred tunnels like this? That would be massive.\" Clockie cannot even imagine what it would look like.<br><br>\"Tick-tock. Captain, aren't you afraid when exploring such tunnels?\"<br>\"Haha! This kind of danger is just a walk in the park. It doesn't hold a candle to our adventure in the Amethyst Forest. Back then, you jumped into Piano Spider's web, and Mirror Princess was so scared.\"<br>\"Tick-tock. Piano Spider is a true gentleman. I still remember the cake he gave us before we left.\"<br><br>The mention of a new story from Clockie piques the origami birds' curiosity, and they clamor for Clockie to tell them more stories. Clockie promises to share his stories one by one once they return to Dreamville, as he has too many to recount at the moment.<br><br>Even with the assistance of their butterfly friends, traversing such treacherous tunnels required immense bravery. However, as everyone witnesses Captain Revolver and Clockie's banters, their fears subside.<br><br>That is precisely what Captain Revolver intended. He is more than just a hot-tempered pistol: His mind is sharp and resourceful. Whenever his companions feel uneasy or encounter difficulties, he will somehow find a way to cheer them up.<br><br>Under his leadership, the silent tunnel has turned into a place filled with laughter and joy, going from a place of terror to a locale full of fun. However, the perils within the tunnels remain, undeterred by their bravery. Soon, a sense of unease begins to creep up on the butterflies.<br><br>\"Captain, we just heard a buzzing sound. It wasn't like the fluttering of butterflies or the chirping of birds.\"<br><br>The tunnels are home to a myriad of creatures, some friendly, but most are not. Since their friends often make sounds like \"whoa,\" \"tweet,\" or \"tick-tock,\" Captain Revolver realizes that the creatures lurking in the darkness are definitively fearsome villains.<br><br>\"Keep it down, everyone. We need to make haste.\"<br><br>Captain Revolver's words carry authority, and even the mischievous Clockie covers his clock hands on his nose to minimize the noise.<br><br>As the team advances deeper and deeper, the tunnels grow quieter. Everyone tries to be as silent as possible and focus on the road ahead, their ears hearing only the faint sound of butterfly wings fluttering. Captain Revolver, shielding his friends, leads the way with extreme caution. However, in the lightless dark, the horrors eventually quietly close in.<br><br>Silently, greedily, swiftly."

It hid in the soil, preparing to ambush and devour Clockie as he passed by.<br><br>However, the ever-vigilant Captain Revolver is one step ahead. Before the creature can even strike, one of his bullets already pierces through its nose.<br><br>\"It's an Old Buzzfly! Watch out!\"<br><br>Without giving the Old Buzzfly a chance to react, another fiery blast erupts from Captain Revolver's head. A mournful cry follows from ahead. Soon, a deathly silence falls over the entire tunnel once more.<br><br>\"Tick-tock. Thank you, Captain. Without you, I'd have become its meal.\"<br>\"Don't get relaxed yet. Old Buzzflies never hunt alone. There must be more of its companions lurking inside the tunnels.\"<br><br>As if on cue, soon, the tunnel is filled with a cacophony of buzzing sounds.<br><br>Old Buzzflies are a bunch of non-vocal monsters, but far more terrifying than any ordinary foes. They will devour everything in their path. Soon, everyone realizes the terrifying truth — these Old Buzzflies have already devoured the forest on the other side of the tunnel, and are now headed towards Dreamville itself!<br><br>\"We've got to stop them passing through here!\"<br><br>However, the tunnel is so dark that not even a glimpse of the Old Buzzflies can be seen. How are they supposed to defeat those monsters? Just as Clockie's gears are about to get stuck in exasperation, brilliance suddenly illuminates the tunnel.<br><br>\"We've come to help you, Captain.\"<br><br>The butterflies flutter their wings vigorously, the shining dust of the scales shimmering like stars as they fall into the tunnel, exposing the repulsive Old Buzzflies and giving them no shade to hide. Captain Revolver expertly pulls the trigger with this light, the muzzle on his head almost spitting flame. One after another, butterflies who have exhausted their phosphoric dust fall to the ground, only to be replaced by fresh reinforcements.<br><br>\"We can't keep up like this. Clockie, my friends, leave now. I'll manage those Old Buzzflies myself.\"<br>\"But...\"<br>\"No 'but.' I'm Captain Revolver. I won't lose to the likes of them.\"<br><br>Seizing an opportunity while Captain Revolver is momentarily distracted, an Old Buzzfly lunges toward him, aiming to vanquish the most valiant opponent present. However, the butterflies form a delicate barrier, their wings breaking in the clash as the phosphorus powder blinds the Old Buzzflies.<br><br>Amidst the unceasing sound of gunfire, Clockie and the origami birds flee desperately until exhaustion overtakes them. They could not take one more step or make one more wing flip. Finally, the familiar sight of the forest and Dreamville re-emerges before them.<br><br>When Clockie leads his companions back to the tunnel, the battle has long concluded. Scattered phosphoric scales adorn every corner, illuminating the tunnel even brighter than daylight. The radiant glow guides them forward through the corpses of one Old Buzzfly after another and out of the cave. The Old Buzzflies have devoured everything — except the stones here.<br><br>\"Tick-tock. Captain? Butterflies? Are you there?\"<br><br>There is no reply.<br><br>With the stones, the shattered town is repaired. However, Captain Revolver and the butterflies never return. Sometimes, sunlight filters through the cracks in the tunnel, illuminating the fading phosphorus powders. Those sparkling colors always make Clockie feel as though someone is trying to talk to him.<br><br>\"Hey, Clockie! Let's go on another adventure!\""

Honor and property of the masses were deemed most appropriate, and those who upheld them were to be duly rewarded.<br>1:32 This law was unquestionable by mortal beings, and all lives of flesh and bone were to forever remember it.<br>1:33 And so it was done.

The Family has harnessed this unique characteristic to transform the once desolate prison into the renowned Twelve Hours. The dreamweaving technology has always been a secret, closely guarded by the five major lineages.<br><br>\"Dreamchasers may find it difficult to manipulate memoria in the Dreamscape, as it is a technique mastered only by the Memokeepers from the Garden of Recollection.\" You may have heard locals or hotel attendants mention this idea when entering the Dreamscape for the first time.<br><br>But the truth is, this statement acts as a \"lock\" imposed on dreamchasers. The Family subtly gaslights all visiting guests by suggesting to them that the rules in the Dreamscape mirror those of reality, leading to their perceived and eventual inability to freely manipulate memoria, despite being initially capable of doing so. This allows The Family to monopolize dreamweaving technology and charge additional exorbitant fees for unique experiences.<br><br>Today, I'll guide you through the first step of unlocking your mind: Learn how to fly.<br><br>First and foremost, it's crucial to grasp that the Dreamscape is entirely different from reality, and the laws of physics, including death, don't apply. So, \"you won't fall when you're in the sky.\" Repeat this mantra in your mind until you truly believe it. However, due to the deeply ingrained perception of gravity and The Family's constraints, freeing your mind can be quite a challenge. To overcome this, I recommend visiting the Polymorph Pawnshop (Click this <i>link</i> now for more details) to temporarily block your memories related to gravity and acrophobia. Just remember to retrieve them before leaving Penacony.<br><br>Now that the notion of falling is forgotten, it's time to defy gravity. Based on our past experiences, it's advisable to find a take-off platform with a free-fall duration of over 8 seconds (calculated using the officially provided gravitational acceleration factors). For a comfortable flight, you can choose to hold an umbrella or wear a cloak to control your movement. Keep in mind that cool-colored umbrellas and warm-colored cloaks yield the best results. (For customers who don't have trichromatic vision, please consult the merchant regarding color standards when making a purchase.)<br><br>The last and simplest step is to select your destination and take a swift leap. Planning your aerial route in advance is crucial to avoid obstacles like spheroids, aerial tracks, vehicles, and buildings, which might hinder your flight experience. To assist you, our team has dedicated an entire Amber Era to create a real-time smart map (<i><u>Click this link now to get it for free</u></i>) covering locations spanning eight Hours. With this map, you'll enjoy a more immersive and unrestricted experience in the captivating Dreamscape of Penacony.<br><br>Follow my blog to uncover the hidden secrets and lore of Penacony. In the upcoming update, I'll introduce you to the second step in jail-breaking the \"lock\": See-Through Vision. Who is the mysterious \"Butterflier\" hidden within the upper echelons of the five major lineages since the creation of Penacony? And how did these major lineages gradually gain control over the entire Dreamscape? Use your See-Through Vision to uncover the truth."

The author seeks to foster cross-group communication in order to find new solutions to the enduring issue of stowaways spanning several Amber Eras.<br><br>Note: This report solely investigates organic beings and Intellitrons who entered the Synesthesia Dreamscape through neighboring starships without applying for proper authorization from the Reverie Hotel.<br><br><b>Chapter I: Even Stowaways Have to Work</b><br><br>Stowaways from impoverished galaxies often exhaust their savings to board ships that can conduct interstellar warps. They rest in bare-bone rudimentary cabins, evading The Family's oversight to sneak into the Dreamscape.<br><br>Contrary to popular perception, unemployed stowaways represent only a tiny proportion in the starships. Faced with the pressures of survival, most stowaways strive to find employment in Penacony. While the job-seeking process is typically difficult for these marginalized individuals, sustaining a daily existence in the thriving Dreamscape can be achieved through simple labor.<br><br>Meanwhile, unemployed stowaways have their own alternative means of survival, often teaching others in their smaller group something akin to begging. They employ a variety of techniques to beg for Alfalfa credits from visitors in the Penacony Dreamscapes and use the money earned to cover their expenses in reality.<br>Rumors suggest that a revered stowaway, known as the \"Great Sage,\" befriended the legendary Watchmaker through the simple means of begging, thus ascending the social ladder. However, this is likely a sales pitch used by human smugglers to attract potential stowaways.<br><br>Some stowaways struggle to adapt to the Dreamscape society and continue working in reality, such as in interstellar deliveries or repair services for passing starships. However, the meager income from low-paying reality often falls short of supporting their indulgence in Penacony. Consequently, these stowaways occasionally resort to criminal activities, such as extortion or blackmailing guests.<br><br>According to the laws established by the Oak Family, stowaways are strictly prohibited in Penacony, as they often face dire consequences when apprehended by the Hounds.<br>However, compared to The Family's pursuit, the damage caused to their brain and psyche by counterfeit Dreampools is even more alarming. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of unprocessed memoria can result in severe physical and mental degradation, with many stowaways succumbing to debilitating psychological disorders in their later years.<br><br>I have covertly inspected the stowaway ships, but unfortunately, by the time I arrived, a prominent special guest had already left the ship. Rumors suggest that these enigmatic stowaways possess substantial financial resources, using Dreampools no less opulent than those in the Platinum Suite. Some may choose to stow away to conceal their identities from The Family, as even the most notorious criminals in the cosmos can easily alter their appearances and find refuge within the Dreamscape in Penacony.<br><br>Some stowaways go to great lengths just to catch a glimpse of the Dreamscape in Penacony and then depart on a small vessel afterward. During a private conversation, the captain of a stowaway starship informed me that these stowaways comprise the majority of their clients, as diving into the Dreamscape in this manner proves much more cost-effective than covering the exorbitant rates charged by the Reverie Hotel.<br><br>As I pen down these words, I find myself marveling at the allure of Penacony. For several Amber Eras, people have been willing to give up everything, just to visit this splendorous dream of Harmony.<br><br>..."

Despite its age, the robot remains functional and diligently attends to the sanitation of 107 compartments in one half of the ship, emitting a melodic hum that praises Qlipoth as it moves. The affordability of its services has even led some stowaways to develop a sense of faith in Preservation.<br><br>Naturally, it also handles the task of \"cleaning up\" deceased tenants or those who could no longer pay, but stowaways have long grown accustomed to this.<br><br>The most popular food among stowaways is the \"Instant Vita Serum,\" which solely relies on the IPC's shipping routes for transportation. Originally created by a \"botanical botanist\" (an intelligent plant from the Cexkal system) during the Borderstar Trade War when resources were scarce, the IPC has since acquired the rights for this product. This nutrient fluid has the advantages of affordability and the fact that \"drinking it probably won't kill you, I guess\" and was extensively used during relief efforts in wars. However, it was eventually banned due to potential safety concerns regarding physiological harm, leading to the closure of the production factory.<br><br>Merchants that had stockpiled large amounts of the nutrient fluid during the war were forced to leave in disappointment, taking with them enough nutrient fluids that could last two planets for three Amber Eras. That was when an affordable life-support product emerged throughout the cosmos. In certain cosmic segmenta, a bottle of nutrient fluid may be worth less than the excrement of a local creature.<br>Experienced stowaways collect empty cans to sell the alloy to the captain at discounted prices. However, they discreetly keep this knowledge from rookies, as that would lead to receiving hush money from the captain.<br><br>\"By the way, does this stuff have a shelf life?\"<br>\"Well, drinking it probably won't kill you, I guess.\"<br><br>Due to prolonged exposure to low-gravity environments, organic stowaways face additional health risks compared to inorganic ones. Common ailments include osteoporosis and endocrine disorders. The cost of daily cabin environmental conditioning, amounting to 10,000 credits a day, remains unaffordable for the majority of stowaways.<br>In the face of these challenges, stowaways who have not yet had a mental collapse due to the effects of high concentrations of memoria ultimately resort to extensive body modifications to gain some extra hours of sleep each day.<br><br>\"Look at me now. All I need to do is dive into the Dreamscape. If only I could never have to wake up.\"<br><br>During an interview with a stowaway named \"Beta,\" it came to my attention that he only had one-tenth of his head left and an inorganic shell weighing about 29 kilograms. After learning about my identity, he kept cursing the captain for deducting the money earned from selling his organic body parts. He insisted on gifting me the last bottle of his much-cherished nutrient solution, as he can rely solely on sub-par batteries for his survival.<br><br>\"Well, drinking it probably won't kill you, I guess.\"<br><br>While writing this section at the Reverie Hotel, an inorganic guest approached me and requested the bottle of nutrient solution. He then invited me to his miniature garden, where he poured the nutrient solution on one of the flowers, causing it to come to life and greet me."

Initially employed by the Alfalfa Family to assist the Nightingale Family with the foundations of the dreamweaving project, Domanda encountered a meme attack during an operation, resulting in severe damage to his electronic components. Unable to continue his work, he was persuaded by the Alfalfa Family and voluntarily left during 2155 AE.<br><br>Subsequently, due to the deterioration and malfunctioning of his logical and Intellitron parts, Domanda made multiple unsuccessful attempts to publicly harass and extort the Alfalfa Family by fabricating false accusations. Utilizing knowledge from his dreamweaving days, he intentionally caused several building collapses and meme-generation events in various locations, including the Golden Hour and Blue Hour, resulting in psychological damage of various degrees to a total of 1,958 individuals. Among them, 35 individuals require special memoria medication for the remainder of their lives.<br><br>Once the culprit is apprehended, the annihilation process will commence immediately.<br><br><br><b>Name: Barnos</b><br>Charges: 7 counts, including unlawful possession of prohibited weapons, aiding and organizing illegal entry into Dreamscape, and assaulting law enforcement officers of the Bloodhound Family.<br><br>Barnos arrived in Penacony as a Dreamchaser toward the end of 2155 AE and settled there. Later, due to his wife's illness, he attempted to auction a hundred years of his life's usage in the Moment of Dusk but to no avail. Subsequently, he engaged in a fight with a Pepeshi merchant who won the auction for \"lifetime\" in an unsuccessful attempt to snatch the auctioned item. As a result, Barnos was expelled and developed antisocial ideation.<br><br>Between the late 2155 AE and early 2156 AE, Barnos repeatedly assisted stowaways in exchange for large sums of money. Consequently, over two thousand stowaways made it to Penacony, with more than two hundred remaining unaccounted for, despite several searches conducted by the Bloodhound Family. In his final years of criminal activities, Barnos incorporated some of the stowaways into his team. According to his subordinates, he mistreated his followers due to their lack of legal status. Eventually, his failure to distribute the spoils equally led his followers to report him to the Bloodhounds, resulting in his apprehension.<br><br><br><b>Name: Lamuin</b><br>Charges: 7 counts, including illegal smuggling of prohibited drugs, market disruption, and distribution of dangerous substances.<br><br>Lamuin arrived in Penacony in the middle of 2156 AE as a travelling merchant. However, a joint investigation by The Family and the IPC revealed that his merchant certificate was obtained through bribery. The individuals involved in the fraudulent activity have been investigated and punished accordingly. Initially, Lamuin sold illegal psychotropic drugs in Penacony and engaged in fraud to sustain himself. Later, he colluded with local criminals to smuggle a significant quantity of memoria products into Penacony via his merchant certificate, gaining market share through dumping practices. This posed a serious safety hazard, as his drugs had not been verified and approved by the Garden of Recollection and Penacony quality control authorities.<br><br>After the Bloodhounds dismantled his illegal industrial chain, Lamuin disappeared for six months. Upon resurfacing, he poisoned guests at The Reverie Hotel in reality as an act of retaliation against The Family. This incident resulted in a total of 130 individuals being hospitalized, three of whom died. Subsequently, the Bloodhounds conducted a thorough search. Lamuin ingested poison in a bathroom in the hotel, committing suicide."

They infiltrated the Dreamscape and collaborated with local gangs and other unlawful entities, including the Masked Fools, with the aim of kidnapping prominent guests attending the auction during the Charmony Festival. They hoped to use this opportunity when the Charmony Festival attracted moguls from across the universe, and leverage the ransoms to generate funds for their future endeavors.<br><br>Their actions drew too much attention, and they were caught red-handed by the Bloodhounds while recruiting new members in a restaurant.

Paperfold University was constructed in the Moment of Sol specifically to suppress this meme through the collective subconscious of students.<br><br>Many of the techniques employed in constructing dreams were actually extracted from this meme by The Family.

That's indicating that The Family is once again interrogating the meme.<br><br><i>HalovianBeauty: \"During the silent hours of the night?\" That's never happening in the Moment of Sol.</i><br><i>SupersmartRoboball: I've been teaching in the academy for an Amber Era and never heard of anything like that.

The spirit, wearing a purple dress and bearing a mirror, has long hair that sprawls across the ground like snakes. When you encounter that spirit, you will realize that everyone around you is missing. Some bolder students have tried to approach the spirit, only to find that the distance between them remains unchanged. In the end, the spirit will let out a sigh, and the unfortunate student will awaken from the dream.<br><br>There are similar records within the fringe areas in other Moments. It is rumored that a Dreamchaser, who engaged in unsavory deeds during the Pioneering Era, was consumed by a meme in the desert, leading to her soul wandering within the Moment of Midnight ever since.

The Watchmaker's Legacy is actually hidden within Paperfold University.</b><br><br>The Watchmaker has generously made numerous donations to Paperfold University's dreamweaving project. Despite being the most successful entrepreneur in Penacony, he never asks for anything in return from the academy. This raises the question: Why? The most plausible explanation could be that he is an alumnus of the academy! In this case, it would make perfect sense for him to support and bestow his legacy upon his alma mater. Furthermore, when you talk about the Watchmaker, what places may come to your mind? The extravagant ball in the Blue Hour? The amusement park in the Moment of Stars? Or Clock Studios Theme Park? If we flip the question around, Paperfold University would be the least expected location for his hidden treasures!<br><br>Secret treasures are typically found in the most unexpected of places. So, what are you still waiting for? We are now recruiting members for our treasure-hunting team to look for the treasure on campus. Once we discover the treasure, all the wealth will be divided equally among the team members.<br><br><i>RobinFan099: I thought this section was about supernatural encounters?

Your constant motherly concern always bugs me, like a swarm of mosquitoes at a summer watering hole. Forgive the venom seeping through my pen at the moment, but you once said, \"Perhaps you can rely on your brother a little bit,\" right? So hold off on the complaints and hear me out.<br><br>I got obsessed with a painter's work a while back — I'm aware that you know all about it, but just listen up. So, I ended up writing some critique essays about it, using my usual analytical techniques — the same ones that those idiots in the field love to criticize as \"peeking into the author's privacy and making it public.\" Yeah, that \"psychological topography\" method.<br><br>Seriously, those old farts really should learn from their late mentors how to shut up and stay calm. They say things like, \"Only lunatics want to reveal themselves unreservedly.\" But we'll see. When their coffins are rotten, which one of those stupid heads won't be exposed nakedly?<br><br>Anyway, I digress again, so let's circle back to the painter.

Perhaps you don't know it yet, the painter, she... actually praised me!<br><br>Considering my \"reputation\" in the community, genuine praise without sarcasm or flattery is rarer than springtime in Snowland.

The idea of having a friend with similar tastes and interests is like having an endless supply of sugar cookies right in front of you!

And don't worry, Claudia was with me on this journey.<br><br>Oh, hold your laughter for a moment! I didn't realize that I had traveled all the way to meet her and ended up leaving before the tea had even cooled. The great painter I admired turned out to be just a housewife with an empty mind and no ambition. All that elegance and goodness of heart? Just a facade, nothing but superficiality!<br><br>I used to hold this great painter in high regard, but now, her name only reminds me of a worn-out brush. It only comes to life when dipped in the pigment of inspiration, but once the oil is washed away, it becomes pale, stiff, and worthless!<br><br>Still, I managed to be polite to this so-called \"talented\" lady, and I didn't even say anything mean! We had a polite chat, a polite goodbye, and, believe it or not, she even politely invited me to write another review of her new artwork.<br><br>Ha, ha, ha! What a perfectly \"polite\" meeting from start to finish!<br><br>So, Lester, I'm not coming home this month, or the next, or the one after that.

If left unaddressed, it could have serious implications for the entire economic system! Recognizing the massive business opportunity in this issue, I solemnly present this business plan!<br><color=#eb4d3dff><u>[Note: Please provide supporting evidence for your statements, and refrain from excessive use of exclamation marks.]</u></color><br><br>II. Activity Format<br><br>Nobody truly knows the Watchmaker, but everyone wants to become the Watchmaker. This mysterious name has swiftly become a sensation across galaxies, captivating countless tourists eager to embark on a thrilling treasure-hunting adventure. Upon arrival, these visitors instead often lose themselves in endless festivities, indulging in neverending pleasure and hedonism.<br><color=#eb4d3dff><u>[Note: Please use concise and precise language.]</u></color><br><br>The economic benefits brought about by treasure-hunting enthusiasts are already apparent to all. Therefore, I think we should seize this opportunity to emulate the legend of the Watchmaker and employ suitable promotional methods to reignite the treasure-hunting fervor within the Dreamscape!<br><br>My preliminary idea is about creating an exquisitely crafted piece of jewelry (such as a scarab made of gold and gems). Then, we will give a captivating legend for the scarab (drawing inspiration from myths and folklore on certain planets regarding this animal) and ensure its prominent display and widespread awareness through intensified marketing. That way, when tourists become weary of ordinary entertainment and material joys available in Penacony, they will be definitely attracted by this unique and profound narrative. After that, we will launch sufficiently thrilling activities at the opportune moment, and will surely receive substantial revenue!<br><color=#eb4d3dff><u>[Note: Refrain from excessive use of subjective language such as \"I think,\" \"I believe,\" and \"definitely.\"]</u></color><br><br>Once the trend is established, we should capitalize on its accumulated popularity by organizing re-runs of this event in phases, while incorporating new surprise elements outside of the guests' expectations, optimizing their joy and entertainment.<color=#eb4d3dff><u>[Note: Objectively present the reasons why the aforementioned strategies may prove effective supported by reliable arguments, and elaborate in detail the events to be re-run and what the surprise elements will be.]</u></color><br><br>III. Market Analysis<br><br>It is widely known that people respect and are fascinated by great or unknown phenomena.<color=#eb4d3dff><u>[Note: It is also widely known that the \"Market Analysis\" section should be based on market research reports, data modeling analysis, and supporting arguments, rather than personal beliefs.]</u></color><br><br>I have heard of a person commissioned by a lunatic to traverse a pit with a candle in hand, only because the lunatic believed that this action would change the world. This illustrates how seemingly purposeless actions often ignite enthusiasm and even obsession in people. After all, the satisfaction derived from the exploration process itself imbues meaning into all aspects of people's lives.<br><color=#eb4d3dff><u>[Note: Refrain from speculative analyses devoid of users' actual needs as the premise.]</u></color><br><br>Fueled by curiosity and the desire for discovery, guests will make investments whose value far surpasses that of the treasure itself, yet still derive immense enjoyment from the experience. This forms the essence of the so-called \"treasure-hunting complex\" and serves as the inspiration behind <i>Project: Scarab</i>!<br><color=#eb4d3dff><u> [Note: Avoid elaborating extensively on your design inspiration, quoting obscure references, or fabricating abstract concepts in a business plan.]</u></color><br><br>IV. Conclusion<br><br>The target of <i>Project: Scarab</i> is to revitalize the tourism economy in Penacony. At the same time, it will fully showcase the city's values and The Family's harmonious love to the visitors who flock here due to our fame. Through this project, we aim to achieve both material benefits and psychological fulfillment.<br><br>With great enthusiasm, I present this business plan in the hopes of making a humble contribution to the success of The Family and Penacony.<br><br><br>Feedback<br><br>1. The content of this plan lacks clarity, coherence, and objective discussion, failing to meet the basic standards of a business plan.<br><br>2. The content of the writing is logically confusing, lacking practical case studies, market research, planning, and specific strategies. It lacks feasibility.<br><br>3.

The idea of being constantly together with someone else is difficult for me to imagine. However, when a Pepeshi develops feelings for you, their attention becomes solely focused on you. This can feel... burdensome.<br><br>Danny will undoubtedly find someone deserving of his wholehearted devotion, but that person should not be me.<br><br>June 10th<br><br>Today is perhaps a memorable day as I had a pleasant conversation with a Halovian. This race is indeed the beloved of all creations, and it comes as no surprise that they are often described as divine beings or angels. Given their elegant and mysterious smiles, enchanting and captivating voices, and stunning and lovely appearance... they are destined to attract attention.<br><br>Mr. Leslie turned out to be more approachable than I had initially expected. We watched a movie together and enjoyed a dinner. Our conversation flowed effortlessly, and he shared stories about how envoys of The Family descended during Penacony's crisis and turned the issue to the planet's favor, as well as the Halovians' efforts in constructing this city of sweetest dreams for the Aeon of Harmony they worship.<br><br>His stories were captivating, and the atmosphere between us was light-hearted. He even kindly escorted me back to the hotel. I appreciated his friendliness and kindness, and I found his beauty captivating. However, there was an undeniable sense of... detachment on him that I couldn't overcome. Perhaps I'm being overly sensitive, but upon reflection, continuing this encounter might not be worthwhile.<br><br>After all, it is said that voice of a Halovian's heart is shared only among their own kind.<br><br>June 30th<br><br>Mr. Screwbrugh is a refined and sophisticated gentleman, or perhaps the term \"maestro\" would be fitting. I must admit that, prior to my arrival in Penacony, I held certain prejudices against Intellitrons due to certain rumors... After all, the actions of Emperor Rubert are well-known throughout the cosmos. However, the Intellitrons here... they are elegantly dressed and display courteous behavior. During my conversation with Mr. Screwbrugh, I could sense his genuine curiosity and respect for organic life.<br><br>His intellect shone through his wise and humorous remarks. Occasionally, his questions took an unconventional or cunning approach, yet they never caused any offense. Through our discussions, I gained insights into various intriguing aspects of the \"Inorganic Life Zone,\" such as their customs, culture, beliefs, and values. Engaging in rational exchanges like this allowed me to catch glimpses of their souls amidst the sparks of knowledge.<br><br>I find this unique race to be absolutely fascinating. Their rationality and purity possess an irresistible allure to me. I'm willing to invest more effort into understanding their kind. Perhaps among them, I may discover a kindred spirit, or even a soul mate.<br><br>July 1st<br><br>Hereby, I'm declaring: I have fallen in love!<br><br>The instant I caught sight of the girl in the crowd, I knew she was the one!<br><br>Rational thinking became meaningless when she smiled at me, and logic lost its value when she spoke to me. Her eyes, like precious jewels, ignited my desire and illuminated my life!<br><br><s>Unfortunately, despite my efforts to establish a connection with her, she showed no further interest in me, but that doesn't matter. She will eventually see me, and someday, her gaze will forever be fixed upon me.</s>"

                "Desc": "Dear Mr. Bloodhound,<br><br>Greetings, please understand that I write this letter with a sense of guilt and unease. As a Motivator, it is my responsibility to assist those who seek guidance, but I must admit that... I am currently feeling worried, and even scared.<br><br>It all began two months ago when a guest named Mullich approached me for help. At first, I was slightly surprised when this well-spoken elegant gentleman approached me to ask for a chat, as I wasn't on duty at the time but just happened to be passing by my place of work. However, he then explained that he had seen me at work before, so I didn't doubt his claim. Our conversation was pleasant, and it wasn't until he bid farewell and made arrangements for our next meeting that I realized I had been engaged in \"overtime.\"<br><br>During our second meeting, we delved into his \"condition.\" However, rather than the medical condition, this gentleman only subtly revealed that he suffered from an incurable disease in reality. As a result, he had been rejected by his family, therefore seeking solace only in the Dreamscape. I couldn't help but feel sympathy for this young, refined gentleman who had to endure such hardships. I offered whatever guidance and solace I could provide. Our conversation extended throughout the entire afternoon, and he eventually disclosed that he was afflicted with severe paranoid schizophrenia, also known as delusional disorder.<br><br>From the third meeting onward, our discussions started to veer off course, and the topic of \"friends\" arose. Based on our previous conversations, I learned that this gentleman hailed from a wealthy background and had enjoyed a successful career and life before his illness. However, he claimed to have never had any friends. Intrigued, I attempted to use this as a starting point to uncover useful insights and made discreet inquiries, and he surprised me with his response as he appeared more than willing to share his stories. He began recalling his unfortunate childhood, characterized by a cold and harsh father, a mother utterly without her own agency, and insincere and flattering guests. He described his feelings of loneliness and helplessness, explaining how he developed a new persona to keep himself company.<br><br>At this stage, it became evident to me that this gentleman was indeed grappling with severe delusional behavior, although not specifically schizophrenia as previously mentioned. It seemed as though he deliberately blurred the lines between concepts such as \"schizophrenia\" and \"dissociative identity\" to lend credibility and coherence to his narrative. I followed his train of thought, and he appeared amused, elaborating on the strength and bravery of his self-proclaimed \"other self\" (referred to as \"W\" here) and how it served as his sole guide and companion. By the end of that day, he had developed a notable level of trust and intimacy with me, repeatedly emphasizing that W would hold me in the same regard as he did.<br><br>We continued to have several more conversations, typically occurring once a week. However, I gradually became aware that this gentleman seemed to be projecting the image of a \"mother\" onto me — Not his own mother who could make no decisions of her own and never loved him, but an \"anima\" who cares for him, loves him, and will stay with him. This development clearly crossed the line between a guest and a Motivator.<br><br>To address this situation, I took the following measures. Firstly, I subtly hinted and guided him, making him aware of the risks associated with such a dependent relationship. However, he skillfully avoided any discussions on this topic. Secondly, I began actively reducing the frequency of our meetings, yet he would still show up at my work at the agreed-upon time, whether I was present or not. Lastly, I had no choice but to have another brief conversation with him and firmly express my refusal.<br><br>During that encounter, he simply stared at me without expression for a while before silently turning away, but I didn't believe that the matter could be resolved so easily. As expected, a few days later, some of my other clients who had sought help from me informed me that they had been stalked and received a threatening letter stitched together from red cut-out letters.<br><br>\"STAY AWAY FROM RAN. SHE DOES NOT NEED YOU.<br>—W\"<br><br>The above account details what occurred. At present, I have temporarily appeased this distressed gentleman by actively inviting him to our next meeting, but that's the extent of what I can do. He is not inherently malevolent, and I sincerely hope that we both will break free from this nightmare soon.<br>Ran"

The script effectively blends elements from the Pioneering Era and the Clockie series, resulting in a captivating narrative and showcasing a high level of artistic quality. Particularly noteworthy is the impressive final scene where Clockie and the Pioneerist simultaneously hit the Dread King. It is highly recommended to retain this scene in the official version.<br><br>However, this administration must remind Clock Studios that there are both virtuous companions and evil villains among the Dreamchasers. During the Pioneering Era, armed conflicts among Dreamchasers often jeopardized the safety of the town's residents, and the Bloodhound Family was devoted to maintaining law and order through their patrols. Regrettably, in this movie, the Dreamchasers are excessively glorified, incorrectly attributing some of The Family's accomplishments to them. This portrayal may be misleading.<br><br>Furthermore, the depiction of the Dog Sheriff potentially alludes to the Bloodhound Family and raises concerns. Dog Sheriff is portrayed as a thuggish security officer, perpetuating a discriminatory stereotype. However, records available in the Moment of Sol suggest that the Bloodhound Family made substantial contributions during the pioneering effort in the barren dreamscapes, on par with the Dreamchasers. Frequent attribution of villainous roles to the Bloodhound Family could lead to audience resentment, tarnishing the Bloodhound Family's image and contradicting The Family's philosophy of Harmony. Therefore, it is recommended to revise the script accordingly.<br><br>We suggest incorporating romantic scenes between the Dog Sheriff and the Pioneerist, replacing their conflicting stances with elements of romance. Recent market surveys indicate that audiences are highly interested in stories of relationships between characters. This approach not only enhances the commercial value of the movie but also conveys Penacony's shared values of harmonious tolerance and friendship.<br><br>Lastly, we would like to bring to Clock Studios' attention that the role of Clockie has been diminished in recent <i>Clockie</i> movies, and in this script is even overshadowed by the Pioneerist. While we understand the strategic direction of Clock Studios in attempting to establish a new series, it is crucial to note that Clockie has always been the iconic image of your studio and even Penacony. Therefore, we recommend maintaining a balanced share of screen time between each character in your future productions.<br><br>I look forward to your future creations.<br><br>— The Iris Family, Dreamscape Film Regulation Administration"

He gained support from several influential founding figures in Penacony, including Hanunue and Glaux, and leveraged this advantage to acquire the right to have a say in decisions regarding this world. He therefore achieved greatness and exerted his will in Penacony, ultimately becoming the \"Father of Penacony.\"<br><br>Despite his esteemed reputation, he has managed to maintain his secrecy through various means. There are over three hundred different types of the Watchmaker's appearances documented in interviews and written records alone. These forms can be categorized into two types.<br><br>The first type of form is often non-human. He would use unconventional items as media for remote communication, with the Sweet Dreams Troupe, Clockie toys, and cartoon ornaments in the Clock Studios Theme Park being the most common. He assumes such guises in most interactions with his partners and employees.<br><br>The second type of form is usually an intelligent life form, potentially, potentially being the Watchmaker's true self. This form commonly appears in eyewitness reports and urban legends. Rumors say he often dresses in gorgeous attire and would appear amidst the grandeur of Penacony, attending banquets with successful Dreamchasers.<br><br>The Bloodhound Family has examined the memories of witnesses and revealed that nearly 6% of the eyewitness reports are genuine. However, it is strange that the Watchmaker appears as a blurred image with a bizarre voice in each memory, with inconsistent details such as body type, appearance, and even gender once these memories have been decoded.<br><br>We hypothesize that the Watchmaker possesses the ability to conceal his appearance on a memory level, an ability often associated with Enigmata. Therefore, there might be external forces supporting the Watchmaker.<br><br>While we acknowledge that the Watchmaker's investments in Clock Studios, Clockie Pizza, and Clock Hand Foundation have contributed somewhat to the development of Penacony, we must not overlook the damage the Watchmaker has inflicted upon The Family's interests. The most severe case was the Clock Credit Crisis, which involved a speculative token introduced by the Watchmaker that severely disrupted the Dreamscape's economy. It took the Alfalfa Family decades to eventually resolve the crisis, causing outrageous market disruption unparalleled in several Amber Eras.<br><br>According to reports from the Alfalfa Family, the Watchmaker has repeatedly employed financial, marketing, investment, and even fraudulent tactics to gain an advantage in emerging markets, encroaching upon The Family's rightful interests. He organizes balls in the Blue Hour to enhance his reputation and continuously expand his influence in society. As a result, many misguided Dreamchasers regard him as their idol, and a considerable number of potential business partners of The Family have been lured towards his enterprises instead.<br><br>Given the aforementioned circumstances, the Oak Family proposes an investigation into the Watchmaker and his affiliated forces in the current system year.

Oh, but what's that mist?\"<br>\"Tweet, Clockie, Clockie, the mist from the desert has swallowed our home.\"<br><br>That was terrible! It was the dreaded mist from the Nightmare Desert, concealing an invisible monster that has devoured many unfortunate souls, although whether the monster eats clocks remains unknown.<br><br>The birds bravely ventured into the Nightmare Desert to get stones to construct Dreamville. The most remarkable stones lay deep within the desert's heart, yet no bird dared to venture there. Clockie's hands anxiously spinned in a circular motion. Tick-tock, he heard the monster's mocking laughter.<br><br>\"Tell me your name, monster!\"<br>\"Haha, Clockie, my name is 'Unknown.' With my two pairs of eyes and two mouths, I shall swallow all of Dreamville, and none shall escape my clutches.\"<br><br>The monster soared through the mists happily, toppling roofs one moment and causing sandstorms the next. Nobody could stand against it. Indeed, this monster was so fearsome that even a cactus would shed its needles in horror at the mere mention of its name. Once again, Dreamville was in the throes of a dire crisis.<br><br>\"Ka-ching! If this continues, Dreamville will become Nightmareville!\" Captain Revolver exclaimed. However, as the town's guardian, he also had no idea as to how to defeat Unknown, an intangible monster.<br>\"Tick-tock, indeed, we must find a way to defeat it.\"<br>\"But how, Clockie? That Unknown is so powerful that it fears neither my bullets nor your clockwork!\"<br><br>...\"I know what it fears most.\"<br>A melodious voice resonated, reminiscent of a song even more beautiful than the birds' a capella. The voice was gentle and exquisite, akin to that of a princess. Adorned with an elegant gown, the lady, with her head being a delicate mirror, gracefully bowed before everyone.<br>She was Miss Mirror, Clockie's good friend once upon a time — She was once the princess of the Mirror Kingdom, and everyone called her the Mirror Princess.<br><br>\"Tick-tock, are you not afraid of that monster, Mirror Princess?\"<br>\"Of course not, my friend. That monster is called 'Unknown,' and its greatest fear lies in being known. Once my mirror reflects its hideous visage, it will no longer remain 'Unknown.'\"<br><br>With those words, Mirror Princess confidently approached the laughing mist. Her mirror emitted a faint light akin to a sword piercing the monster's eyes. Gradually, the mist dissipated, and the arrogant monster let out a wail.<br><br>\"No, no, no! Don't let me see that! Mark my words, you nuisances! I shall return again and devour you all!\"<br><br>The monster let out a shriek and fled, and the town was restored. Clockie and Captain Revolver threw a grand celebration in honor of Mirror Princess. The townspeople danced with joy, singing songs and praising her courage, and baking the most tasty cakes for her.<br><br>\"Even if that monster will return, don't worry, Clockie! Let's keep the momentum and get rid of that villain once and for all!\"<br><br>A wonderful idea! Once they defeat the villain, the birds will be able to find stones and branches from the heart of the desert, making Dreamville even more splendid!<br><br>In the meantime, Unknown was hiding in its lair, making malicious whirring cries. Realizing that the princess of the Mirror Kingdom was its nemesis, it was trying to figure out a way to take her down.<br>...Since Unknown was a nefarious villain, it soon came up with an idea, and it was the most malicious plan imaginable."

It's so fun there! Everyone is a mirror!\"<br>\"Yeah, mirrors of all shapes — round, square, star-shaped, and others. And I happen to be the most esteemed kind, the round-shaped mirror. That's why when you arrived there, I mistook you for the 'Mirror Prince'!\"<br><br>Amidst laughter, Clockie thought back to the beauty of the Mirror Kingdom, and the days he spent traveling alongside Mirror Princess and Captain Revolver. They had explored countless enchanting places, but none could compare to Dreamville as it is now.<br><br>Clockie believed that with the aid of his friends, together they could turn Dreamville into the best place in the world.<br><br>...Suddenly, sinister laughter pierced through the silence of the desert.<br><br>\"Hahaha! This isn't Dreamville, but the Nightmare Desert! And I'm the king of all nightmares!\"<br><br>Clockie was certain that he had never heard a voice so malevolent before. Even a notorious arch-villain like Boss Stone paled in comparison to such vileness. The voice seemed to be both distant and near, but whenever Mirror Princess's radiance illuminated their surroundings, the voice would shriek and retreat in haste.<br><br>They continued moving forward, their steps echoing endlessly, until it seemed as if the desert-enveloping mists had dissipated. A whole new world was revealed to them. However, Clockie soon realized that the vast expanse of the desert managed to deceive his senses. It was not until dusk that they finally arrived at a place engulfed by dense fog.<br><br>\"This must be that monster's lair.\"<br><br>Mirror Princess stepped forward bravely, and with each stride, the mist receded in reluctance. But then a sudden alarm echoed in Clockie's mind.<br><br>\"Tick-tock! Stop there, Mirror Princess! It's a trap!\"<br><br>Too late! His warning was in vain. Beneath the mist, the Unknown laid a long rope on the ground concealed by the mist and tripped Mirror Princess's foot. With a resounding crash, she tumbled to the ground, shattering into countless shards. At that moment, the mist resurged, and the malevolent and satisfied laughter from the Unknown once again swallowed the entire desert.<br><br>\"Ka-ching! What should we do, Clockie? Mirror Princess has been shattered!\"<br>\"Tweet, what should we do, Clockie? The monster will devour us all!\"<br><br>\"Fear not, my friends. It's not the time to cry. Please gather my shattered pieces.\"<br><br>The desert resonated with a gentle, familiar voice. As everyone collected the scattered shards of the princess, they cascaded vibrant auroras amidst the golden sands. The shattered mirror pieces were everywhere, and each reflected the visage of the monster — a short, clownish, and craven ghost. The \"Unknown\" was deprived of its power and vanished forever, its final curtain accompanied by a wail of anguish.<br><br>However, having fulfilled her purpose, Mirror Princess could not even utter her final words. The Origami Birds discarded all their stones and Captain Revolver spat out all his bullets. Together with Clockie, they meticulously gathered the shards of the princess — the sole remaining treasure she left behind.<br><br>Despite her shattered form, Mirror Princess continued to guard Dreamville with her radiant glow. Whenever the mist returned bringing new monsters with it, the mirror would show their forms, continuing on to this day.<br><br>...<br><br>With the arrival of a new day, Clockie swung open the door to his house, revealing the mirror they had meticulously reconstructed, peacefully resting in the garden of Dreamville.<br><br>\"Tick-tock.

The fact that we're the following act to preceding masterpieces like <i>Cyberville</i> and <i>Starshipville</i> has also added no small amount of pressure.<br>Though this might be a world of dreams, the art of animation doesn't quite work like how people assume.

Sometimes, he is a clock that hides beneath the desk, and sometimes he turns into a bubble. These little scares he inflicts have become one of his few pleasures.<br>However, the Watchmaker is quite severe and strict when it comes to animation production — a far cry from the usual whimsy humor he exhibits on a day-to-day basis. I cannot help but admit he has tremendous capability when it comes to writing scripts.

I wanted to create animations I can understand, not the frenzied imaginations of my boss!<br>I've requested two days of sick leave from the producers. I'm going to see a Motivator.<br><br><b>2157 AE, Day 421 Since Project Initiation</b><br>The scheduled Motivator is absent because he apparently also scheduled a Motivator.<br>But I really don't have much left in me to keep going with this. I worked up the courage to contact the Watchmaker in the hope of tendering my resignation.<br>To my surprise, however, the esteemed chairman didn't rebuke or beg me to stay. He just started chatting with me like a friend.<br>I ended up telling him about all the stuff I wanted to discuss with the Motivator. Things about my time as a student in the Chroma Star System and all the frustrations I experienced at Clock Studios. He listened attentively, spending Aeons know how long on me, a mere unremarkable animator.<br>After hearing my thoughts, he even sincerely apologized to me, and patiently explained everything about <i>Clockie</i> to me. He explained why he had to create this project and went over all the details I didn't understand.<br>We spoke for an entire night, till the producers entered the room and asked me to start the work day.<br>I decided not to quit after that conversation.<br>Not because the boss talked me down, but more that I want to speak with him more in the future.<br><br><b>2157 AE, Day 729 Since Project Initiation</b><br>After countless tribulations, after many turnovers in the cast and crew, our project is entering its final stages.<br>Though the process of its creation was hellish, witnessing the final product made me feel an ineffable sense of happiness. It was a joy greater than can be found in any Dreamscape.<br>But the greatest contributor of all — the Watchmaker — was nowhere to be seen. He didn't appear in our initial screening in any shape or manner, nor did he express his thoughts about this creation.<br>But I believe that the Watchmaker will definitely appear when Clock Studios needs him. Just like Clockie always comes running when Dreamville calls."

Net profit stood at ■■■■■■■■ Alfalfa credits, a year-to-year decrease of 17% and a quarter-to-quarter increase of 0.7%.<br><br>Animation revenue accounted for approximately 33% of the total, reaching ■■■■■■■■ Alfalfa credits, showing a 27% year-to-year decrease.<br>During the first three quarters, two Clockie movies and 37 episodes of the Clockie animation series were released, of which the ninth season of the new Clockie series and <i>Clockie's Big Adventure: Oceania</i> accounted for 49% and 51% respectively.<br>It is clear that animation remains a vital aspect of the Studio's business. However, the missing {RUBY_B#\"Watchmaker\"}Chairman{RUBY_E#} caused an impact on the production capacity for the <i>Clockie</i> series, resulting in a significant downturn in ticket sales and the growth of revenue.<br><br>Image licensing revenue accounted for approximately 29%, reaching ■■■■■■■■ Alfalfa credits.<br>Throughout the quarter, products such as Dressable Clockie, Origami Bird Drone, and Lil' Brother Hanu Game Console, released in collaboration with Pikapi Toys Factory, achieved favorable results in the market. The Studio will continue investing in relevant products to facilitate the production of higher-quality merchandise.<br>The Legal Department is actively seeking a solution to the upcoming risk of image copyright expiration and striving to reach a legal consensus with Interastral Peace Entertainment as soon as possible.<br><br><br>Clock Studios Theme Park generated a revenue of ■■■■■■■■ Alfalfa credits, accounting for approximately 18% of the total.<br>Due to the promotion of the Charmony Festival, the theme park's capability in attracting customers and revenue has significantly increased. Investments in iterating amusement programs yielded a positive response, with a 15% rate of return. Investments in visitor services achieved the highest rate of return at approximately 24%. It is expected that during Charmony Festival, the Clockie Celebration will break through the profit highpoint in the fourth quarter.<br><br>Revenue from collaborations outside of Penacony accounted for 11%, while collaborations and merchandise sales within Penacony accounted for 79%. The marketing department should enhance promotional efforts and market competitiveness in the outside world, particularly in segmenta within The Family's influence, to ensure long-term success in expanding the <i>Clockie</i> series beyond the Dreamscape into the wider cosmos.<br><br>Revenue from other investment projects accounted for approximately 9%, reaching ■■■■■■■■ Alfalfa credits.<br>Notably, the investment and development of dream bubble movies emerged as a new growth driver for Penacony's entertainment industry. Market forecasts suggest that dream bubble movies may surpass traditional movies within half an Amber Era and become the new cornerstone of Dreamscape Media.<br><br>The Clockie IP will remain the flagship product of Clock Studios for the foreseeable future. However, it is currently facing several challenges. Our inventory of <i>Clockie</i> animation content is nearly depleted and the highly-anticipated <i>Dreamville Legend</i> series, which has been in development for five years, must be released in theaters next quarter.<br>The finance department emphasizes the urgency of establishing contact with the {RUBY_B#\"Watchmaker\"}Chairman{RUBY_E#} to make new strategic decisions. Failure to do so could pose a significant risk to the financial stability of Clock Studios' capital chain."

However, I must remind you that you now hold the position of not only her elder brother but also the head of the Oak Family. Your every action has implications for all of Penacony.<br><br>As Penacony is going through a critical period, it is crucial that you do not allow your hatred to cloud your judgment, and be cautious not to engage in activities that others can use against you as leverage. I heard that you are planning to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources to find \"Death.\" Such action does not serve the best interests of The Family as a whole, and I strongly advise you to reconsider it to avoid potential impeachments from other family heads.<br><br>While you are convinced that \"Death\" is connected to the Watchmaker, I have met that Watchmaker many times long before the Dreammaster adopted you and your sister, and I have never found any evidence linking him to that Memory Zone Meme. Now that you are the head of the Oak Family, it is essential that you assess the situation objectively and consider the bigger picture. It is unwise to allocate all of Penacony's resources and manpower for the sake of a personal vendetta, as this would bring dishonor to the Great One!<br><br>The Charmony Festival is on the horizon, and the Watchmaker's guests are all barely holding back their own agendas. Neither you nor I could face the severe consequences if Dominicus' arrival is delayed. Therefore, I urge you to control your emotions and fulfill your responsibilities as the head of the Oak Family, focusing only on the Festival and avoiding any interference from external sources. In addition, we must not neglect the honored guests invited by the Watchmaker, as mishandling this matter could lead to diplomatic conflicts with other major factions, involving us in disputes that could have been avoided. As your elder, I hope you comprehend the gravity of the situation and handle it appropriately.<br><br>As for the matter of Robin, there would be time to pursue it once the Festival concludes. By then, I will provide you with the necessary resources and manpower in the name of the Alfalfa Family to help you get your revenge.<br><br>Additionally, I have heard rumors that the Dreammaster is not entirely pleased with your recent activities.

I had intended to visit you at Dewlight Pavilion as soon as possible upon my return, but with the approaching Charmony Festival and your busy schedule, I refrained from troubling you. However, an urgent matter compels me to share something with you immediately.<br><br>Since my return to Penacony, I have experienced a peculiar change in my voice. At first, I thought it was caused by exhaustion or illness, but after consulting with doctors, they assured me of my perfect health and dismissed my concerns. However, my voice worsened over time, and I even experienced periods of complete voice loss.<br><br>In order to find answers, I conducted many private investigations (using my idle time out of rehearsals, of course). Eventually, I realized that the Harmony in Penacony is not pure. A discord lurking within has tainted my voice of Harmony, which I believe to be the root cause of my vocal issues.<br><br>I immediately realized that such levels of interference can only occur if either a powerful external force is pulling the strings, or if a senior member of The Family is involved. Unfortunately, further investigation has led me to the latter conclusion.<br><br>This is an extremely alarming discovery: A traitor has emerged within The Family in Penacony, and it is highly likely that this person is one of the four family heads. (I trust you implicitly, dear brother, because of our promise). With the Charmony Festival on the horizon, I fear this person intends to impede its progress, or even use the festival for some ulterior motive. At any rate, I suggest you monitor the other family heads while also prioritizing your own safety. You are the only true family member I have left.<br><br>There is another matter that requires our attention. During my investigation, I learned about the Memory Zone Meme \"Death,\" and my further inquiries led me to believe that the culprit who directed it to cause this series of incidents is likely the aforementioned traitor in The Family. I have collected more clues and am prepared to verify my hypothesis. Rest assured, you can just focus on the preparations for the Charmony Festival.

Ironically, even the effect of a half-minute commercial is better than this. It seems to me that Penacony is doing extremely well economically these days, or the Alfalfa Family wouldn't be wasting their money like this.<br><br>All the characters in this film remind me of Mr. Soda in <i>Clockie</i>, with their brains filled with SoulGlad. The protagonist meets the love of his life after picking up a bottle of SoulGlad, making a name for himself in the dreamscapes by selling SoulGlad, and rising to become the Festive Superstar by singing the SoulGlad advertisement jingle. The movie ends with everyone dancing with a bottle of SoulGlad in their hands in a scene where SoulGlad is overflowing everywhere... Holy moly, there's more SoulGlad in this flop than I've seen in my entire life!<br><br>Come to think of it, this film is probably a success in terms of promoting SoulGlad. After all, after two torturous hours of watching the movie, the audience desperately needs something nice to drink to soothe their battered souls.<br><br><b>02: <i>Insect Cyclone: The Sixteen-Headed Insect</i></b><br>Genre: Disaster/Thriller<br>Rating: 1/10<br>Comment: One of a kind in terms of floppiness<br>Review:<br>When \"Insect Cyclone: The Three-Headed Insect\" first came out, I didn't expect a film of such poor quality could have so many sequels.<br><br>So, when I saw its 13th sequel making it to the box office chart, I had no intention of wasting any more ink on this film made of tacky special effects and an AI-generated script. However, I must criticize those who have contributed to its box office — when you buy a ticket for this film, you are filling Grady Films's grave.<br><br>In terms of cinematography, this film is a 0. The one point is for its art team, who managed to design a Swarm monster with 16 heads, 32 pairs of wings, and 64 limbs — it's surely no easy feat. If they can pull off a monster with more heads in the next sequel, I'll consider giving the film another 0.5 points.<br><br><b>03: <i>Meme Crisis</i> (Dream Bubble Remake)</b><br>Genre: Thriller/Adventure/Dream Bubble<br>Rating: 2.5/10<br>Comment: A terrible attempt of rehashing an old film.<br>Review:<br>When <i>Meme Crisis</i> was released back then, I gave it a score of 5. If you have read enough of my reviews in <i>Silver Screen Shockwave</i>, you will know that this is one of the higher scores I've given.<br><br>Regrettably, Grady Films seems to be too vested in trying to add more heads to the Swarm nowadays. Not only does the most advanced dream bubble technology fail to capture the essence of the original film, but it also ruins what's good about it. The director has zero clue about the difference between a dream bubble narrative and using cinematography to tell the narrative. It only repeatedly forces the audience to go through a non-interactive process, then stand around and read a bunch of dialogue that has nothing to do with them. This is funny — if a dream bubble movie is only about moving the scenes in a film into a dream bubble, then I might as well just lie on the couch and watch the original film.<br><br>If you are interested in this movie, I'd suggest that you get an old disk of the original film instead of wasting your money and time on this trashy dream bubble.<br><br><b>04: <i>Clockie: Mecha Town</i></b><br>Genre: Animation/Comedy/Adventure<br>Rating: 4.5/10<br>Comment: A cookie-cutter film that lacks in originality.<br>Review:<br>As we all know, <i>Clockie</i> is the most popular animated film in Dreamscape. It is the most renowned work by Clock Studios and one of the most valuable cartoon characters in the universe. Nevertheless, due to the success of <i>Clockie</i>, Clock Studios seems to be resting on its laurels and settling in complacency, as evidenced by <i>Clockie: Mecha Town</i>!<br><br>The plot structure of this animated film is almost identical to <i>Clockie: Cyberville</i> from last year. Both films start with Dreamville facing a crisis, followed by Clockie searching for external help, and making new friends, and end with Clockie rescuing the whole town by relying on friendship and teamwork... The same plot has been used over and over again. Don't the producers find it a snoozefest?<br><br>For first-timers to the Clockie cartoon films, this is definitely an excellent work. But if you are a fan of Clockie who has already watched films of the series numerous times, there are no surprises in stock for you.<br><br>Recommendation of the Month<br>Recommended by: Chabro<br><br><b><i>A Fading Nebula</i></b><br>Genre: War/Drama/Mystery<br>Rating: 9/10<br>Comment: An unparalleled masterpiece.<br>Review:<br>This film is a classic piece by one of the most famous directors in the cosmos: Mr. Reca. Once again, he demonstrates his exceptional talent in this film.<br><br><i>A Fading Nebula</i> integrates reality and romance as well as tenderness and brutality in the 1,500 shots that make up the 200-minute film. The story took place in the Slaturg Nebula that fell half an Amber Era ago. Mr. Reca makes the Intellitron leader who rules the nebula the protagonist and depicts the happenings during the final six months of the nebula from the leader's perspective.<br><br>Just like Mr. Reca's past works, the film has a realistic and delicate touch that makes the viewers feel like they are walking down the protagonist's memory lane. The lesser-known actors are truly into their characters, the plot is suspenseful, and the editing is masterful... These are enough to make <i>A Fading Nebula</i> a movie remembered by history.<br><br>Rewatching this film makes me reminisce about the time when I was pursuing my artistic dream in the past... It is unlikely that I can create something as outstanding as this film at my age, but I hope that with my words, I can bring awareness to the movie industry that we need more great artists like Mr. Reca!<br><br>Note: According to the information received by our journalists, it seems that Mr. Reca has developed an interest in Penaconian dream bubble technology and is preparing a dream bubble film. This is truly a piece of delightful news for every cinephile. I believe his work will bring a breath of fresh air to the currently lackluster cinema and revitalize the industry!"

We should make more of these in the Dreamscape!\"</i><br><i>\"...No.\"</i><br><br>Boss Stone and his minions trembled in terror, overwhelmed by the creations of the Origami Birds. They sought refuge inside Town Hotel.<br><br>This caused Professor Owl to worry. The hotel was the most magnificent building in Dreamville and the most profitable business in town. It must not be damaged!<br><br>Seeing the formidable weapons halting at the gate, hesitant to attack, Boss Stone understood the birds' worries and let out a sinister laughter. \"Hahaha, you dare not attack me, you stupid birds! Minions, come to me! Toss some lit matches and torch these monsters down to ashes!\"<br><br>The crocodiles hurled the ignited matches at the Origami Birds' weapons, reducing them to ashes.<br><br><i>\"Repelling them in the Dreamscape is just a temporary solution... Even if we defeat the crocodiles here, our firepower disadvantage in reality remains desperate. If we lose the central sector, all the kids in the Dreamscape will be in danger...\"</i><br><i>\"Don't worry, Professor ■■■■. We still have Hanunue!\"</i><br><br>Oh, right. Brother Hanu has returned, and he is the protagonist of this tale!<br>However, with his tiny size, how is Brother Hanu expected to defeat those colossal crocodiles with their fearsome jaws?<br><br>Professor Owl furrowed his brow, the Origami Birds sighed with concern, and even Clockie, transformed into a statue, reflected worry in his eyes. However, Brother Hanu remained resolute, his expression unwavering as he silently advanced toward the hotel.<br><br><i>He let out a confident *hmph*!</i>"

I wish to express my deepest regret for this.<br><br>Let us first consider the painting itself: Beneath a vast and brilliant starry sky, a black lighthouse symbolizing human civilization and order looks frail and insignificant — like a small boat drifting in a boundless ocean. All it would take is a single storm or a lone tidal wave to completely wipe any trace of its existence from the face of the earth.<br><br>And the composition of this image uses exaggerated lines that are perpetually flowing like a spiral. These lines devour everything like frothing waves, spinning, agitating, and upheaving, constructing everything while deconstructing everything.<br><br>As for technique, the artist's brushwork at this time was still a little underdeveloped, with a still immature palette. And compared to the dreamy style of later works, it is obviously too \"conservative and photo-realistic.\" However, from this painting, we can easily glimpse into the artist's <b>reflections on \"people\" and \"the world.\"</b><br><br>\"When we look up to the stars, what are we looking at?\"<br><br>Every time we look up and gaze out at the vast and inscrutable universe, we are inevitably faced with our own insignificance. Humans — or rather, all civilizations of intelligent life — are nothing more than a fleeting and fragile candle flame before the unfathomable and mysterious might of nature.<br><br>However, in this painting, all phenomena in the world — be it the eternal night sky, the boundless universe, the insignificant lighthouse symbolizing humanity, or the shaft of light beamed out from that lighthouse — are fundamentally just twisted lines randomly doodled by Imaginary Law.<br><br>We come from the stars, and are no different to space dust. Everything in this world is ultimately meaningless.<br><br>So, in this cold and empty tone, what answer has our painter given us?<br><br>Take a look at the mysterious violet tones dotted into the indigo night sky. The constellations are giving off these gentle pale yellow lights. These lights contrast and harmonize with the flame in the lighthouse, so we feel the restless joy of time passing, but also warmth ignited in this cold long night.<br><br>Thanks to these colors, those messy and restless lines no longer look cold and ruthless because they are faithful to nature. They still flow — looping back and forth, never stopping — but they emanate a gentle halo due to having been stained by the warmth of human souls, bringing a touch of life to the vast and empty night sky.<br><br>Even if reality is nothing more than a dream... Even if the universe was not created for humanity... We still need to pursue the sky that belongs exclusively to ourselves — be it in a painting, or in our dreams."

                "Desc": "03. <i>Coastline</i>: Metamorphosis & Rebirth<br><br><b>Author: Louis Rice</b><br><br>In this edition, we will briefly critique the painter's breakout masterpiece: <i>Coastline</i>.<br><br>As an important messenger leading the painter into the public eye, the brushstroke techniques in this painting are more mature, and the painter's unique dreamy style has basically taken shape. Numerous interpretations of this piece have been offered up by art critics and academics. Those famed works are familiar to all, so I won't repeat them here. Rather, this author shall continue on the same train of thought as before: An analysis of the artist starting with the work.<br><br>I trust that old friends already familiar with me also understand my methods of analysis, but due to the artist's popularity, these essays have recently attracted some attention and following. Because of this, I will share with new readers an outline of my line of thinking at the start of each chapter.<br><br>There is a general consensus in academic circles that artworks cannot be equated with their creators. This is a concept verified by countless cultures over the centuries and seems to be an immutable truth. But this author believes that so-called works are ultimately no more than the product of splicing fragments from the creator's subconscious mind — just like dreams and hallucinations which often reflect in detail the deepest desires of the heart, which even the creator remains unaware.<br><br>And the more you understand the creator themselves — the environment in which they grew up and their life experiences — the more accurate this process of inference will be. Therefore, on this basis, we will briefly review the topic of the first two notes: In <i>Night of the Majestic Cosmos</i>, we can clearly see the artist's <b>love for art and beauty, the strong desire for freedom, and their reflection and love for humanity</b>.<br><br>And in the second painting, the <i>Death of Robin</i>, the artist instead portrays a severely formulaic and solemn yet disheveled funeral to express their weariness and displeasure at the tediousness of boring reality.<br><br>Bearing this premise in mind, we may then turn our focus to this famous <i>Coastline</i>. The background of the entire painting is composed of a triad of beach, ocean, and sky. Their borders echo each other diagonally across the canvas between top-left and bottom-right in the shape of the golden ratio. At the same time, from the beach in the bottom-left to the sky in the top-right, spans an arc comprising four clear themes strung together: A molted black snake skin, a white soaring bird, a golden cloud, and a crimson sun.<br><br>Based on this author's interpretation, the beach, ocean, and sky respectively represent the material world, the mental world, and aesthetics itself. While the molted snake skin, the soaring bird, cloud, and sun represent the inner ideals of the artist. Burdens of life lie abandoned like a molted old snake skin, while the artist reborn is like a bird freed from the shackles of earth, rushing toward those brilliant clouds symbolizing freedom and spirituality. And the sun, high in its zenith, is the manifestation and embodiment of truth, goodness, and beauty — the goal and desire which the artist eternally longs for.<br><br>The artist also makes creative use of color and line. The brushwork for the beach in the painting is solemn and forlorn, while the undulating ocean uses thick and heavy brushes, and the sky uses graceful and light lines. The colors of the four themes are black, white, yellow, and red which correspond to the nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, and rubedo processes in alchemy. Thus, three dimensions are used to symbolize the metamorphosis and rebirth of the artist.<br><br>Everyone knows that <i>Coastline</i> was a huge turning point in the artist's life. This thick and heavy work could perhaps be understood as the painter putting everything on the line in coming to Penacony, or it could be understood as the painter being a precocious dark horse that rose up through a single masterpiece. However, in this author's estimation, this point had already been revealed in the artist's work itself — even before this painting was made."

This painting represents the complete maturity of the artist's style, establishing them as the unparalleled icon of the pure reductionist school of art.<br><br>However, before formally discussing this work, please allow me to share a piece of good news: After reading the previous issue, the artist actually replied to my comments to express appreciation and endorsement for my series of analyses!<br><br>At the time of writing this issue, we have exchanged letters several times. The artist's words are simple, yet reflect a peaceful elegance and tolerance between the lines. After a simple exchange of ideas with the artist, I have grown to admire them even more. So, I have decided forthwith to pick myself up and take leave for Penacony as soon as this issue has been penned, such that I might witness the stunning appearance of this great artist.<br><br>Let us put aside such idle talk and turn our attention back to this incomparable masterpiece. Every time I gaze at this work, I always find myself subconsciously slipping into the painter's mental world, and it is undoubtedly an extraordinarily wonderful process:<br><br>When first beholding this painting, the viewer can only glimpse a soft, misty halation like clouds of mist. These halos then shift and change, evolving into a mouth made of rubies and pearls, an eye carved from gold, and gorgeous crystal tears flowing from the eye. Starting at the corners of the eye, those teardrops march in formation to form contours and vortices — together with the eyes and the mouth — all creating a twisted, bizarre human shape out of the void.<br><br>But then, amid this fuzzy yet dazzling halo, these condensed images shatter with a bang. And so we see the gold dim and the gemstones bleed, and we hear the pearl wail and the crystals crack... These delicate creations are now filled with searing pain, as though trapped within a cruel nightmare of shadowy terror from which they can never awaken. Meanwhile, we are startled awake by these uncanny dream fragments, falling headfirst back into reality.<br><br>Here, the artist has shown us an abstract yet very real nightmare. By using a light and splendid palette, she gives those vague concepts and real desires a tangible shape — before ruthlessly smashing them to pieces:<br><br>Who would have thought that a fleeting halo symbolizing creativity would sink into vulgar luxury? The greedy mouth built by banality gnaws at the primal serenity, bedecked with glittering jewels yet horrifying and ferocious. Those once-clear eyes corrupt into gold by vulgar contamination, and even the flowing tears are unavoidably dried and congealed into dazzling crystals.<br><br>Where, then, does this plague of ostentation come from? Thriving Penacony, rapturous Penacony — You bring humans dreams and entertainment, yet breed all sin under your cover. Song, dance, wine, and gambles fill up people's bodies and simultaneously drain their souls. So, then, how many have drowned so far in that mirage and intangible dream, only to become a joyous and bloated cadaver?<br><br>As for this invisible spiritual disaster, the artist keenly takes in the entire scene at once and performs deep reflections. She smashes them one-by-one — Giving up perspective, abandoning logic, dissolving boundaries — the artist uses a bright, light color palette to refine, recreate, and brutally shatter this nightmare of vain luxury.<br><br>This is a fierce duel between destruction and re-creation with arrogance hidden among the serenity. The artist uses it to complete her own pilgrimage — a journey home for the pure of soul.<br><br>And when we peer through these crazed appearances into the soul of the artist — one that's delicate yet wild, aloof yet scorching — then our souls, too, shall quiver akin to hearing the first bolt in a thunderstorm.<br><br>The author remains curious: What kind of life experiences formed such astonishing genius? And now, I will personally visit the residence of this great artist to seek out an answer. From here on out, I, too, will be embarking on a pilgrimage of my own."

The hotel immediately sent people to investigate and, after no answer was gained for quite some time, security personnel opened the door — only to find the room empty, with just a wide-open dream device operating by itself.<br><br>We then launched an emergency search throughout the hotel, even asking people to confirm the status of the missing guest in the Dreamscape. Fortunately, nothing was wrong with this guest inside the Dreamscape. So, at least for now, his body seems undamaged and his mind remains within Penacony. To protect the guest's mental well-being, we will not inform them for now. To address this, the hotel has dispatched a team to conduct close follow-up observations on the guest.<br><br>We hope that his body can be found soon.<br><br><b>X/25</b><br><br>There have been some... rumors around the hotel these days. I first caught wind in the tearoom: A maid said she could hear a rustling scratchy voice when passing by \"that room\" in the middle of the night — like a rat nibbling on wallpaper. But how could Penacony have rats?<br><br>Even the kitchenhands started to talk about this later. Apparently, another young waiter sneaked into \"that room\" again, and <b>it really was empty inside</b>. But after that, the sound still kept appearing. And it got louder... and louder.<br><br><b>X/26</b><br><br>Finally, I heard it myself — the sound they'd been talking about. The three hours I spent waiting outside that door wasn't in vain, after all. I slipped in before the sound disappeared. Everyone has been getting antsy recently because of that rumor about \"the guest who got eaten by the dream device and turned into a wandering specter.\" As the head nurse, it is my duty to clarify this ridiculous delusion.<br><br>It was a scratchy sound. It rustled like a rat nibbling at the wallpaper, or like an angry ghost struggling. I looked back to see the guest room door was still open. The sound came from behind the wardrobe over in the corner of the room, so I took a few steps over, and the sound got louder. I paused for a second, then I tried to call for him: \"Mr. Sealy?\" Then I heard a loud, rasping laugh. That sound... it was strange, more like an off-tune weak scream or a painful whimper instead of laughter. I felt my vision going dark and my body freezing. But the sound drifted off after a while, so I bravely took another few steps forward and called out again.<br><br>However, that sound suddenly stopped. At that time, my curiosity got the better of me and I leaned over the wardrobe to peer behind it into the gap between it and the wall — I saw a large pair of bloodshot eyes and a set of wriggling white teeth that was both terrifying and sinister. And then, I heard a weak, breathy roar saying:<br><br>\"Sa—Save me!\"<br><br><b>X/28</b><br><br>This morning, the hotel issued a revised guest guideline and dreaming regulations. What happened to Mr. Sealy gave us all a wake-up call to recognize the flaws and oversights in our original workflow. For this purpose, we have made the following improvements:<br><br>1. Guests with any history of sleepwalking will have additional limb support measures taken while entering the dream to prevent accidents from occurring during sleep.<br><br>2. The layout of hotel rooms has been optimized to prevent smaller guests (such as the Pepeshi) from getting stuck between any furniture again.<br><br>As for poor Mr. Sealy, the mental trauma he suffered seems to exceed any weakness caused by dehydration and hunger. The hotel pledges to provide him with the best recuperating environment and the most meticulous care.<br><br>We sincerely hope he will make a speedy recovery."

For a long time, we were not clear about the essence behind the presence of emotions. By conducting a physiological analysis of various life forms in the universe, this article attempts to answer the challenging yet significant question: What are emotions?<br>Keyword: Emotion, physiology<br><br><br>1. Human Emotions<br><br>Before moving to Planet Screwllum, I met Emma, an unusual brain cancer patient. She became a changed person after having her tumor removed. From being enthusiastic and active, she transformed into an anti-social, irritable, and aloof person. Intellectual-wise, she was not affected, and she remained an excellent college lecturer. Yet, she could no longer handle her teaching work.<br><br>After a thorough examination, I found that Emma's reasoning, memory, attention, and other cognitive abilities were not impaired. Still, she had problems feeling and reacting to things that happened to her. In other words, she was suffering from a severe emotional disorder.<br><br>...<br><br>By analyzing these data, we can draw a firm conclusion that the existence of human emotions is reliant on certain bodily tissues. Fear is associated with the amygdala and resentment with the insula. The expression and regulation of emotions are controlled by the prefrontal cortex, while empathy and remorse are related to the insular cortex and cingulate cortex.<br><br>...<br><br>So, does this suggest we could potentially manipulate or even control human emotions by altering these physical organs? On the other hand, if some life forms do not have those tissues as humans do, does it mean they are without emotions?<br><br>2. Emotions of Inorganic Lives<br><br>To find answers to these problems, I visited Planet Screwllum, a place crowded with inorganic lives. With Screwllum's help, I gained access to the mechanical lifeform lab. I saw a structure completely different from the one of humans when I scanned the body of a mechanical life form.<br><br>Case 1: A mechanical girl who escaped from the Annihilation Gang exhibited a strong sense of guardedness against all external matters. Her core circuit showed signs of burn.<br>Case 2: An elderly mechanical being was unable to move after the passing of a family member. Upon examination, there was no issue with his body, but he was unable to answer questions posed by external sources.<br>...<br><br>Electricity flows in their body like blood. Although mechanical lifeforms are nothing like humans, I can see them having similar torrents of emotions. Could this be just an illusion? Or could emotions be unrelated to any physical organs, and instead are dependent on something that transcends physiology?<br><br>...<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>When I was leaving Planet Screwllum, a good friend of mine got emotional when sending me off. It was the first time I had seen tears in shiny, silvery color when they trickled down his crystal-like face. At that moment, I felt love — I was very sure about that.<br><br>So, what exactly are emotions? Instead of being a privilege exclusive to certain life forms, it is the essence of all life forms. It is an abstract behavioral pattern and a common inner language. Perhaps, this language was already known to all life forms when they were created. By virtue of this language, all beings are able to understand each other, giving rise to the existence of love.<br><br>More questions will be solved by future research.<br><br><br>Acknowledgements<br><br>I would like to thank Mr. Screwllum for providing the lab.<br><br><i>Ruan Mei's Annotations:<br>Emotions are the common language of all life forms... That's the conclusion ██ spent an entire lifetime to reach.<br>Perhaps ██ was simply that kind of person, but I find it hard to agree with or even understand this finding.<br>I wish I could ask her about it.</i>"

Then, add a little light soy sauce and oyster sauce to the tapioca pearls, and add the onion and ginger juice then stir and marinate for 15 minutes. Add the cabbage slices to the Trotter eyes, mix until the mixture is firm, then set it aside. Knead the fermented dough, roll it into round xiaolongbao skins, put the filling inside, and steam them in a steamer over high heat. When the water boils, switch to low heat. Once you turn off the heat, let it simmer for two to three minutes before opening the steamer lid.<br>Flavor: The xiaolongbao skin is chewy, and the filling is tasty with the perfect balance of savory and sweet flavors. It tastes even greater with milk tea!<br><i>...</i><br><i>(The graceful yet solemn ellipsis has a hint of doubt and incredulity)</i><br><br>Stargazer's Pie<br>Main Ingredients: Galactic indigenous fish, the gaze of innocent eyes, the screams of ignorant fools<br>Additional Ingredients: Hard-boiled eggs, potatoes, onions, and bacon<br>Seasoning: Olive oil, chicken stock, red wine, and cream<br>Instructions: Clean the fish, remove its internal organs, and cut off its head and tail to use later. Cut the rest of the fish into half and stuff it inside the crust. Dice the onions and potatoes and slow-cook them in chicken stock and cream before pouring them into the crust. Add the gaze of innocent eyes and bake it with the screams of ignorant fools for half an hour before serving.<br>Flavor: Creamy and milky taste, rich in fat. A must-have at gatherings!<br>Note: Let's do stargazing together!<br><i>This is getting weird...</i>"

Once you get used to it, your sense of smell will be distorted, and the odor will make you feel happy.

You, general, are the unwavering pillar of Luofu and the backbone of the Alliance. Any misfortune that befalls you would have dire consequences. Therefore, I implore you to prioritize your well-being and seek solace for recuperation.<br><br>With the growth of the Ambrosial Arbor now halted, the Realm-Keeping Commission is committed to eradicating any remaining disturbances as per our duty. The recent calamity has affected various delves, including the Starskiff Haven, the Divination Commission, and the Artisanship Commission. Once we have thoroughly assessed the extent of the damage, we will collaborate with the Artisanship Commission to commence reconstruction work.<br><br>Madam Yukong, the Sky-Faring Helm Master, has diligently enforced blockades and inspected our airspace for hidden dangers in the aftermath of the calamity, and I need not elaborate on her splendid efforts here. However, it is disconcerting to note that Amicassador Tingyun has been replaced by an imposter, leading to unsettling rumors within the Commission. Moreover, rumors about the growth of the Ambrosial Arbor are bound to spread beyond the confines of Xianzhou with departing merchants, and we can anticipate an influx of Elixir Seekers in the near future, perhaps reaching another historical height. How many of them would be covert agents serving the Plagues Author? And how many would be ignorant individuals consumed by their blind desire for immortality? Their insatiable demands will undoubtedly sow the seeds of hidden turmoil.<br><br>Master Diviner Fu Xuan of the Divination Commission has ventured to the frontline, leading troops to apprehend the Stellaron Hunters and accomplished great feats. However, it must be noted that Fu Xuan's temporary assumption of command over the Cloud Knights surpasses the bounds of propriety, as dictated by the regulations of the Six Charioteers. Once you, general, have regained your strength, I beseech you to resume your rightful position.<br><br>During the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis, Lord Zhu Lun, the head of the Artisanship Commission, was absent on a visit to the Xianzhou Zhuming. Consequently, all matters pertaining to the Commission were overseen by the esteemed Master Artisan Gongshu. While he possesses great skill in craftsmanship, he lacks practicality and management acumen. Nonetheless, his unwavering dedication and courage in maintaining his post during the calamity are commendable.<br><br>The situation within the Alchemy Commission is exceedingly complex. Due to reasons known to all, the position of the commission's head has remained vacant for an extended period. Currently, Chief Alchemist Yuluo is serving as the acting head. However, perceptive as you are, I believe you have already foreseen that once the situation stabilizes, the Alliance will appoint a new head for the Luofu, inevitably stirring up another storm. If we can make preparations in advance, we will be better equipped to navigate the impending tempest.<br><br>Since the rebirth of the Arbor, the Alchemy Commission has lost the trust of the citizenry, with outworlders even developing a sarcastic proverb \"just like the Alchemy Commission\" to laugh at how Xianzhou has been blind to such treason. The Realm-Keeping Commission has issued numerous circulars emphasizing the expected conduct and hospitality of officials and ordinary members. At this critical moment, the Realm-Keeping Commission must focus on calming the situation and preventing any further escalation of tensions with visitors.<br><br>Medicine is the cornerstone of people's livelihoods, and employing medical practices aligned with Reignbow's revelations to aid outworlders in overcoming their ailments is a crucial aspect of combating the Plagues Author. In my humble opinion, rebuilding trust in the Alchemy Commission among civilians must be our foremost priority. To this end, I shall actively seek assistance from all other commissions.<br><br>Please accept my apologies for any disturbance caused by my letter. I sincerely wish you a swift recovery, general.<br><br>Huifu, Realm-Keeping Commissioner"

The series has become commercialized now, but they've taken it too far!<br>Back in the early years, the Angler Mystery still had some detective work and logical reasoning. But what is it now?<br>It's all about flashy, over-the-top scenes!<br>I know what those publishers are thinking. The end-of-year specials have become a tradition for the series, and they hate it when us long-time fans that grew up with the Angler get more critical. Plus, it's been two hundred years, and they've pretty much exhausted every crime trope in the cosmos.<br>So what do they do? They create these ridiculously badass criminals and give the villains insane powers! Find differentials and increase the extent of crimes on an industrial scale!<br>I get that they want to maximize the commercial value of this series, but they can't just throw in elements that don't fit! Guess what? Every villain in the Angler Mystery is all about destroying the whole Xianzhou or blowing up planets.<br><br><br>It always goes like this: A deus-ex-machina device saves the day, or a super powerful football comes from hundreds of miles away and breaks through the villain's starskiff, or some super-duper guy shows up and tears apart an aurumaton with their bare hands. It feels like I'm watching an exaggerated superhero extravaganza! You know what? I think the Angler should just quit being a detective and join the laser-ball tournament in Taikiyan! Not even the brutal Chainsaw Overlord Zakk would stand a chance against him!<br><br>And let's not forget how repetitive the recent stories have become. It's like they were written by an AI following a pattern:<br><br>The Angler presents his deductions.<br>The Angler has an emotional scene with the heroine, his childhood sweetheart.<br>The Angler sympathizes with the second heroine who has also undergone a hatching rebirth.<br>The Angler's sidekicks reminds you of their and the plot's existence and give right-to-the-point hints.<br>Detectives from the Realm-Keeping Commission and the heroine's dad show up and make deductions, but of course, they're always wrong.<br>At a crucial moment, the Angler conveniently solves the crisis using some new expertise that has never been mentioned before, and he'll say, \"I learned it before my previous hatching rebirth\" to make it sound believable.<br>The heroine interacts with her wealthy foxian friend.<br>The officers from the Realm-Keeping Commission drag others down and only show up after the case is already solved.<br>And don't get me started on the miraculous inventions sent just at the right time from the head of the Artisanship Commission that defy all types of physics, along with his terrible jokes that nobody laughs at.<br>Oh, and let's not forget the heroine's ancient martial arts skills.<br>And the fact that the Tea Society always has undercover agents from the Ten-Lords Commission.<br>And that chivalrous master thief who looks exactly like the adult version of the Angler<br>...<br><br>Yeah, the Tea Society is just a joke now. At the beginning of the story, they seemed like the most badass gang ever, and look at them now? EVERY SINGLE MEMBER is a covert agent from the Realm-Keeping Commission, Ten-Lords Commission, Seat of Divine Foresight, or some other organization. So, in reality, there are only two people who actually work for the Tea Society, Pu'er and Longjing, right?<br><br>And to those die-hard fans who accused me in my previous comments, I have something to say. I used to be a huge fan of this series, just like you. Every time a new novel or immersia was released, I'd be the first to buy it, and I never missed paying for any of the end-of-year or limited or special series.<br><br>But you know what? I just can't keep up anymore! Come on, Master Su Fang, use your brain! Can't you write at least one decent detective story like you used to? Do you really think you can write nonsense like this and still rip our hard-earned money?"

You're smarter and more patient than those military nobles, and you're not the type to seek \"revenge\" over a mere insult.<br><br>Shouling: Furthermore, the greatest difference between you and the others is that you are not one of the Sky-Defenders who share power among them, and you can never join them... Therefore, you don't care about the wingweavers' military coalition. All you care about is your own clan. Am I right?<br><br>Shouling: And that's why we have apprehended you and your entire clan.<br><br>Xili: (Remains silent for a while)<br><br>Xili: Can I ask a few questions?<br><br>Shouling: Of course.<br><br>Xili: If I attack them, can you guarantee... that I'll make it out alive?<br><br>Shouling: No, I can't guarantee that.<br><br>Xili: But what about my clansmen?<br><br>Shouling: The Alliance will grant them pardons for their crimes. They will be protected fairly in the name of Reignbow, but they will not be allowed to proliferate. Does that sound fair?<br><br>Xili: Well, fair enough.<br><br>Shouling: Deal?<br><br>Xili: ...Deal.<br><br>..."

The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus aimed to replicate fantastic creatures made by the celestials in previous millenia. These experimental creations closely resembled the military war beast documented in ancient records, both in terms of nomenclature and physical characteristics.<br><br>However, there is one particular experiment that took place during the tenure of Dan Shu's predecessor, whose current whereabouts are unknown. All names of individuals involved have been erased due to the disappearance of the previous chief alchemist. Given the current uncertainties, and being unable to inquire the people involved regarding the purpose of the experiments, I have prepared a concise summary.<br><br>The experiment involved the injection of Vidyadhara blood and marrow fluid into various species, including those with scales, feathers, fur, long-life volunteers already exhibiting signs of being mara-struck, some short-life species, and outworlder volunteers. The objective was to observe the reactions of these organisms in both their normal state and mara-struck state.<br><br>The supplementary data is outlined here (For further details, kindly refer to the attached document.)<br><br>\"Subject No. 4. Class Scaled, Genus Osteichthyes. On the day of injection, the subject exhibited molting of its existing scales, with the growth of a cuticle observed on the head. Secondary bone development occurred in the head, and noticeable enlargement of the mouthparts was observed. Hair growth was also observed near the dorsal fin and gills of the test subject...\"<br><br>\"Subject No. 8. Class Furred, Subspecies Canis... On the following day, the subject displayed signs of mania, with gradual shedding of nails and teeth. However, the corresponding organs grew back even sharper on the subsequent day. Keratosis developed on the subject's neck and tail. The subject was killed and its body destroyed after attacking and wounding two alchemists...\"<br><br>\"Subject No. 1-E. Class Feathered, berrypheasant. After being injected with █ drops of marrow fluid, the subject experienced the shedding of feathers and its symbiotic berries within half a day. The subject's entire torso underwent stretching and elongation, while its head acquired characteristics resembling those of other creatures. An organ resembling a forelimb emerged from its chest. The subject was subsequently terminated...\"<br><br>\"Subject No. 1-F. Class Furred species, yellow boulder oxen... Two days later, the subject's skin exhibited signs of mutation that resembled scales, joint reflexes were observed, a sarcoma developed on the forehead, and accelerated growth of horns and hooves took place. The subject was subsequently terminated...\"<br><br>\"Subject No. 2-C. Xianzhou human. Long-life species. The subject already displayed early signs of being mara-struck, and both the family and the volunteer consented to participate in this experiment. Following the injection of marrow fluid, no significant relief from the mara was observed. However, it is worth noting that after the subject became fully mara-struck, the subject's self-consciousness remained with remarkable clarity compared to other mara-struck individuals. Their level of sanity was comparable to that of a normal person. Subsequently, the subject unilaterally believed themselves to have been cured and refused further ███████, and the Commission had to undertake necessary measures to ███████ the subject.\"<br><br>\"Subject No. 4-B. Outworlder. Short-life species. The subject, in a short-life species' middle/old age, willingly participated in the experiment after learning its purpose. After being injected with marrow fluid, the subject's cellular activity was activated, resulting in significant improvements in bodily functions. The original deteriorating body experienced revitalization, with restored vision, liver and kidney functions, and alleviation of pain caused by certain joint diseases. The subject exhibited no adverse reactions, except for localized scaling of the skin...<br>...However, an accident occurred during the experiment. After █ weeks, the subject's body displayed reverse growth, regressing from a middle-aged state to a childlike form. The subject's mental faculties deteriorated significantly. Eventually, after ██, their body ██ liquified, ███████ temporarily recorded the conclusion of the experiment as 'having disappeared due to unknown reasons' in the report.\"<br><br>\"Subject No. █-█. Short-life species, race ██████. The subject was deceased when delivered, and the body was donated posthumously for experimentation. We administered marrow fluid into the subject's body with the assistance of ██████. The marrow fluid even exhibited a revitalizing effect on the deceased body, resulting in profuse hair growth and skin molting. Horn-like cuticula emerged on the head, indicating ████████.<br>However, the subject did not revive as anticipated. Instead, it seemed as though the physical body was unaware of the brain's demise and continued to proliferate in a disorderly manner. The presence of Vidyadhara bone marrow was so mighty even in a deceased body... The test did not achieve ██████ desired expectations. As a precaution, the subject was promptly terminated before ████████.\"<br><br>Due to the content being damaged and space constraints, I will refrain from providing further elaboration on reports of a similar nature to the ones mentioned above. The remaining information primarily concerns dosage, injection timing, cycles, variations among experimental subjects, and related details.

                "Desc": "To the General Affairs Office,<br><br>Under the wise guidance of the Six Charioteers and the Ten-Lords Commission, the Disciple of Sanctus Medicus' conspiracy, headed by Dan Shu, to take advantage of the Ambrosial Arbor to overturn the Luofu has been thwarted. All the culprits have been apprehended and their leader has been annihilated. All on the Xianzhou Luofu exerted their efforts together to snap this catastrophe in its bud. However, while Dan Shu's rebellion has been suppressed, its aftermath has caused severe effects on the lives of ordinary civilians. Here is a report on recent events.<br><br>Firstly, due to the impact of Dan Shu's rebellion, a faction of unruly individuals instigated public unrest against the alchemists and healers of the Alchemy Commission. Last week, a group of ruffians defaced the temporary site of the Alchemy Commission, openly denounced all the commissions on the Xianzhou, and propagated the heresy that only the Ruin Author will bring an end to the plague. Some civilians even broke into the former Alchemy Commission site to plunder supplies, resulting in physical altercations with the Cloud Knights on guard there. Currently, all troublemakers have been apprehended by the Cloud Knights, and further investigations have shown that they are all outworlders hired by the Annihilation Gang. We are currently collaborating with the Cloud Knights to suppress these riots and have arrested all individuals responsible. This case is currently under trial.<br><br>Secondly, the Realm-Keeping Commission, in recent collaboration with the Sky-Faring Commission, has apprehended a gang of criminals suspected of smuggling Xianzhou native creatures to the outworlds. This operation has led to the arrest of fifteen suspects and the shutdown of ten processing and warehousing facilities. The criminal group had been smuggling and stockpiling a significant number of biological samples from the Xianzhou under the guise of research activities, disguising the goods as trade commodities to be exported. We followed their trail and while destroying their headquarters, we also apprehended former Disciples of Sanctus Medicus on the run who are planning on smuggling themselves out of the Xianzhou. This case is currently under trial.<br><br>Thirdly, various unaffiliated individuals on social media platforms have been making claims that the Ambrosial Arbor, after its resurrection, emits an ominous aura that accelerates the onset of mara. This rumor has spread widely among the residents and caused panic. Certain groups believing in the Firmamend Arbiter cited their myth as evidence and argued that a colossal wall must be built around the Arbor to completely ward off its potential effects for eternity. These outworld groups even proposed their plans and submitted them to the Realm-Keeping Commission. However, the feasibility of their plans are absurd, and the costs involved are enormous. After being rejected several times, these groups have resorted to soliciting donations from the public and promoting their view that the construction of a wall can ward off the demonic aura. They are currently facing legal consequences for engaging in illegal fundraising activities.<br><br>Fourthly, following the Ambrosial Arbor's rebirth, certain merchants have deliberately spread false information for personal gain. They claim that the Lunarescent Depths possess the ability to suppress the ominous aura from the Arbor, and thus begun promoting the water from that sea as a medicinal remedy. Some more extreme cases have seen shops promoting ordinary salt as \"Lunarescent Depths Salt\" and sold it at exorbitant prices, inciting people to stockpile salt. Such actions have severely disrupted the market order and have wildly influenced commodity prices. Currently, the Realm-Keeping Commission is cracking down on a handful of prominent merchants involved in this deception, imposing fines and revoking their licenses.<br><br>Fifthly, due to the lack of trust in the Alchemy Commission after the disaster, medical scams have proliferated. The primary victims of these scams are elderly Xianzhou natives who have sought treatment from the Alchemy Commission before, have suffered the loss of their children during the calamity, and are old enough to become mara-struck soon. Swindlers use hooks such as giving out free food to get these people intrested, then employ various methods such as presenting themselves as health experts, miracle-working doctors, or anti-Alchemy-Commission progressives to offer health products that purportedly delay the effects of mara. They exploit the victims' trust, spread rumors, and capitalize on anxiety, while falsely advertising these health products as elixirs and selling them at incredibly high prices. The Realm-Keeping Commission has apprehended numerous suspects and dismantled their sales channels. Additionally, we have published anti-fraud notices in each residential community, making residents aware of frauds and suspicious individuals.<br><br>Sixthly, at the beginning of this month, the Sky-Faring Commission and the Realm-Keeping Commission thwarted a case involving the illegal departure of a collective group at Cloudford. The organization, known as the \"Sunrise Traveling Group,\" primarily comprises elderly widows, widowers, and people who have lost their children but have not yet succumbed to mara. These members refer to each other as family, claiming to find solace in their spiritual companionship after losing their blood relatives. Based on their statements, they started exploring spiritual therapies such as meditation and spiritualism due to them feeling at a loss over the purpose of their lives. During their meditative sessions, many members experienced the shared vision of a black sun hanging in the sky, which they refer to as \"Obsidian of Desolation.\" The organizers of the group purchased books and coordinates related to the <i>Obsidian of Desolation</i> from the black market in Aurum Alley, subsequently organizing this pilgrimage for the group members.<br><br>The Realm-Keeping Commission is highly concerned regarding this matter and has at the earliest opportunity dissuaded the group to return. Currently, we are investigating the organizers and have arranged for the rest of the group to return home or accept priority treatment from the Alchemy Commission. We plan to organize community workers who specialize in caring for seniors to monitor the mental status of the group members. Furthermore, we will intensify our monitoring of Aurum Alley's markets to eradicate illegal peddlers with dubious backgrounds.<br><br><br>In summary, while Dan Shu's rebellion has been quelled, its repercussions have had a significant impact on various aspects within the community, including matters of faith, the business environment, and even the credibility of authority. While these issues may appear minor and isolated, a closer examination reveals their interconnections, as several of these cases involve organizations beyond the Xianzhou Alliance and other religious beliefs. For the next step, the Realm-Keeping Commission will prioritize its efforts to calm the people's minds and strengthen their spiritual resilence and unity. I submit this report to you, Commissioner, and eagerly await your assessment of the public's general mood. Additionally, the Exalting Sanctum Chancery would like to hire more hands, or have personel transferred over from other departments as we are currently severely understaffed.<br><br>Yours Respectfully,<br><br>Dahao, Official of the Realm-Keeping Commission"

Our journey led us to scour battlefields in search of war relics, seek out freed slaves, and even conduct field research by infiltrating borisin settlements under the guise of an IPC trade team.<br><br>Throughout our research, we lost three researchers, including my own mentor.<br><br>Now the research and data compilation effort spanning six decades has drawn to a close, we humbly present this tome titled <i>Borisin Folk Song Collection</i>. Within its pages, you will find a comprehensive compilation of two hundred and fifty-one oral epics and ballads of the borisin, serving as a valuable reference.<br><br>Dr. Zongguang, Anthropologist from the Luofu Grand Virtue Academy<br><br>...<br><br>27. The Birth of Duran [1]<br><br>Borisin were short-lived, skinner than most.<br>We dared not move about in broad daylight, fighting for survival in the shadows of night.[2]<br>In clouds came, down rain poured, lightning flashed and thunder roared.<br>A din, a crack, a peal, a crash, and from the sky fell flesh and blood smashed.<br>Muttering prayers with scrape and bows, the great Shaman fell on his knees, repeatedly genuflected,<br>claiming that this was a fortuitous mark, a sign of the Master of Immortality's heart.[3]<br>Seventy-two days later, the tribe's chieftain child was born.[4]<br>Strong and powerful as a wild beast right from the womb born,<br>That was Duran, our first Warhead.<br><br>Footnote:<br>[1] This folk song holds significant importance in the ritualistic practices of the borisin. It should be noted that the borisin possess a distorted understanding and interpretation of the concepts embodied by the Plagues Author. Instead of establishing worship for the Plagues Author, the first Warhead, Duran, cunningly utilized this worship to solidify the foundation of the borisin's racial identity.<br><br>[2] Current archaeological excavations have verified the authenticity of this aspect. During the era preceding their acquisition of long life, the borisin indeed endured slow progress due to the harsh natural environment of their homeworld.<br><br>[3] No concrete evidence supports the occurrence of this plague catastrophe in history. Certain historical sources suggest that the author of these songs fabricated this legend to validate the divine legitimacy of Duran's reign.<br><br>[4] The motif of \"a baby born after mere days of conception\" is a recurring heroic theme in borisin songs and has become an established literary device. According to their songs, nearly all of their Warheads spent only a few days in their mothers' wombs.<br><br>...<br><br>28. Duran's Pilgrimage to the Master of Immortality [1]<br><br>Duran treads the thorny road, seeking the Master of Immortality,<br>that borisin might rule over all creation, from death and suffering given salvation.[2]<br>But the Master of Immortality did not bless all, saying only the strong would never fall.[3]<br>The Master of Immortality commanded the foxian, myriads strong to guard the tree of mystic where the weak didn't belong.[4]<br>Master of Immortality then left Duran with a beast, the Taowu seeking the sweet dew from the treetop, a feast.<br>Duran and the Taowu tore through the ranks, killing thousands upon thousands as their foe's numbers shrank.[5]<br>THEY killed till flesh shards and broken bones filled the air. THEY killed till living foxian would show neither hide nor hair.<br>Duran walked the river of blood to the divine tree, and piously taking the dew from the freshest branch tip, took a knee.<br>Duran, immortality claimed, asked the Master again: \"Would you not share your blessing with my fellow kin?\"<br>From the clouds the great Master let dew fall to the land, and all creatures now lived till the cosmos's end.[6]<br>Having enlightened existence, the Master of Immortality commanded, that the million foxians vanquished would be by defeat branded:<br>\"Conquered by Duran, who conquered the tree, you shall be borisin's slaves for perpetuity.\"[7]<br>Granting the borisin bodies of steel, he mandated us to conquer the heavens to repay his goodwill.[8]<br><br>Footnote:<br>[1] While this folk song is a significant foundation of the borisin's collective racial memory, its historical accuracy is questionable. It indeed portrays several important events in the borisin's history, but does so with a considerable amount of dramatization.<br><br>[2] Existing historical and archaeological evidence suggests that the unexpected rise of the borisin can be attributed to the indiscriminate dissemination of the plague catastrophe by the Plagues Author. After all, considering the level of civilization of the borisin during that time, it is implausible that they actively initiated contact with the Aeon.<br><br>[3] Even for the Plagues Author, this statement would be a blatantly defamatory remark. It is evident that the borisin interprets the concept of \"Abundance\" based on their own cultural norms and values.<br><br>[4] This folk song fabricates a narrative in which \"the Master of Immortality ordered the foxians to test the borisin,\" using this fictional myth to provide a supposed justification for the borisin's enslavement of the foxians.<br><br>[5] Based on current archaeological evidence, it is believed that after the borisin gained longevity, at least two Amber Eras had passed before they created the beast ships they currently use. The reference to \"Taowu\" in this context should be considered fictional. After all, without the means for interstellar travel, it is impossible for Warhead Duran to embark on a pilgrimage to the Aeon.<br><br>[6] This portion is intriguing. According to the story, the Plagues Author did not originally intend to bestow immortality upon all individuals. It was the Warhead who requested this blessing for everyone. This supports the editor's assertion in the commentary in Song #27 that \"Instead of establishing worship for the Plagues Author, the first Warhead, Duran, cunningly utilized their worship to solidify the foundation of the borisin's national identity.\"<br><br>[7] The purpose of this part is solely to legitimize the borisin's enslavement of the foxians.<br><br>[8] Similarly, the purpose of this part is to legitimize the borisin's policy of plundering and invading other civilizations.<br><br>..."

However, I have been shunning from writing my own stories.<br><br>This avoidance stems from my deep-rooted mistrust of words. Language, like a delicate butterfly, has existed since the birth of humankind thousands of billion years ago. Words, however, are merely dessicated specimens of language. They may initially appear beautiful, but upon closer examination, they resemble more and more as lifeless corpses. Reluctant to extinguish the flame of my oral tales, I have refrained from the act of writing.<br><br>Yet here, I publish this book, not merely to preserve the tale, but to document a miraculous encounter.<br><br>One evening, I was weaving stories at the Sleepless Earl as usual. I can no longer recall which story I was telling. All I remember is that as soon as the chapter drew to a close, an outworlder in the crowd stood up and applauded vigorously.<br><br>It was a woman wearing a large broad-brimmed hat. The hat was pushed down low over her head, casting a shadow over the upper half of her face. All I could see was a joyous smile on the corners of her lips. Her sudden action startled the other audience members and they all turned to look at her. However, undeterred by their attention, she walked towards me and said, \"Mr. Xiyan, I've long been an ardent admirer of your work.\"<br><br>Not knowing her intentions, I responded cautiously. \"It seems this is the first time you have graced my performance.\"<br><br>\"Indeed, indeed,\" the woman lowered her head as if feeling a tinge of remorse. \"How could I have only managed to come and listen to your storytelling for the first time today? If not for my companions' reminders, I fear I would have remained oblivious to your brilliance forever... Please accept this gift as a show of my sincerest apologies.\"<br><br>Before I could express my gratitude for her bizarre praise, she was raising her right hand. It was only then that I noticed she was holding a cage covered by a white cloth.<br><br>\"You possess a remarkable talent for transforming 'history' into 'legend'.\" She placed the cage on the table in front of me, paying no heed to my refusals. \"Enhanced by the power of this parrot, your performances will become even more miraculous.\"<br><br>And with that, she turned and was about to leave, and I had no choice but to try stop her. \"My lady! This gift is far too valuable... I don't deserve it...\"<br><br>\"No, you have done so much already.\" She stopped in her tracks, turned back toward me, and showed the glazed color of her eyes underneath her hat. \"Your 'stories' can infuse color and vitality into this dry and dusty history.\"<br><br>...<br><br>It took me weeks to figure out this parrot's temperament, during which I almost starved it to death, narrowly avoiding wasting that lady's good wishes.<br><br>The parrot seemed to have a fondness for me alone. When seeing anyone else, it would enter a shocked state, going as stiff as a board. I had to cover its cage with a cloth to avoid it being scared to death by other people. However, I had to bring it outside with me. It would become equally disturbed if it were left in the house alone for too long. Terror, shock, freezing up — the whole routine.<br><br>Thus, I had to carry this cage covered in a white cloth wherever I went... the Sleepless Earl, Spices Supreme, and the market. I even had to carry it during business discussions with the esteemed Mellow-Golden-Mayor higher-ups, like some form of performance art.<br><br>Just as I was beginning to think it was all some elaborate prank the lady was pulling on me, the parrot finally revealed its extraordinary side.<br><br>Firstly, I discovered that the parrot possessed an exceptional memory. As long as it listened once to the stories I said, it would be able to recite these. While animals capable of speech are rare in this era, I have still encountered my fair share of such wonders. Being a parrot, even if it had swiftly learned to copy the human language, it would still be limited by its instincts as a parrot.<br><br>However, I soon realized that the parrot was not merely recounting my performances. Initially, it diligently \"recited\" them, but then it began to \"reinterpret\" them, even taking the liberty to alter certain plot elements. I must admit, its modifications were remarkably effective, enhancing the original narratives and infusing them with greater believability.<br><br>As time went on, it started telling stories that I had never told. Some, I suspect, it overheard while accompanying me on the streets, while others remained a mystery, their origins unknown to me.<br><br>Dear reader, you may be inclined to believe that the parrot possesses exceptional intelligence. However, I, for one, fail to perceive any qualities within it that would make it a skilled storyteller.<br><br>It refused to take flight and remained silent unless in a cheerful mood. When it felt happy, it would chattered away endlessly with stories, yet retreated into its cage and sulked when its mood turned sour. Once, it perched on my desk and waddled into my hand like a goose, affectionately nuzzling against it. Just as I delighted in its cuteness, cradling the plump bird in my palm, it left a warm deposit of bird poo in my hand and flew off once more.<br><br>Such a simple-minded creature could never comprehend the intricacies of a complex story.<br><br>I surmise that its behavior remains confined within the realm of parrot instincts. As we all know, parrots mindlessly repeat human words without grasping their meaning. It's just that after thousands of years of evolution, perhaps they have refined their ability to mimic human speech, and eventually they became able to tell stories on their own.<br><br>However, does a lappet moth realize that its \"mimicry\" is indistinguishable from a dried tree branch? I speculate that my beloved parrot remained unaware of the true significance behind the stories it shared. Perhaps it didn't even realize that it was narrating tales.<br><br>After much contemplation, I decided to transcribe the tales it shared with me and share them with others.<br><br>For months, I attentively listened to its stories, meticulously recording the most captivating ones. Once the work was complete, I held the manuscript in my hands and posed a question to my parrot. \"What name would you suggest for this book?\"<br><br>It hopped onto the manuscript, gazing at me with a perplexed expression. But then, it straightened the feathers on its neck and chirped leisurely:<br><br>\"With plume like phoenix's feather it soars. Its beak sings melodies from heavenly shores. When quill rests, no chirping bird in sight. Such are these Otherworldly Delights.\""

However, over time, we started neglecting the perils of the past, despite being long-life species who retain memories. The re-allocation of power from the Alchemy Commission to other organizations was never fully complete, and we have lacked in monitoring and correcting the behavior of Alchemy Commission's members. These oversights were the fundamental cause of the crisis surrounding the Arbor's resurrection.<br><br>A significant portion of the apprehended Disciples of Sanctus Medicus in this operation were affiliated with the Alchemy Commission. Our inquiries among innocent members of the Commission revealed an atmosphere permeated by nostalgia for past authority and status, coupled with discontent with the current status quo, and a sympathy toward Sanctus Medicus and its mastermind, Dan Shu. The deep-rooted origins of the Sanctus Medicus scourge must not be underestimated.<br><br>From the accounts of her accomplishments, Dan Shu appeared remarkably virtuous, even considered exemplary among healers on the Xianzhou. She authored medical texts, formulated prescriptions, and received numerous accolades. Following the banishment of the previous Cauldron Master of the Commission, Yunhua, amidst a dispute regarding the Vidyadhara, Dan Shu assumed practical leadership of the Alchemy Commission in the Luofu. If not for this incident, she might have become the actual Cauldron Master of the Commission.<br><br>I am aware that the other Six Charioteers want to see a Luofu Alchemy Commission without a nominal head, perhaps believing it the only way to ensure the Commission stays harmless. However, it is precisely within the context of a leaderless Alchemy Commission that nefarious leaders like Dan Shu can emerge.<br><br>My assistants and I have thoroughly examined all administrative documents of the Alchemy Commission spanning the past seventy years. The records of Dan Shu's inhumane experiments and her correspondence with suspected Vidyadhara Preceptors indicate that this incident was not an impulsive rebellion by individuals masquerading in the name of an ancient cult, as it may seem, but rather a meticulously organized conspiracy.<br><br>To prevent further turmoil, I implore the Ten Lords to issue a decree for further dissolution and monitoring of the Alchemy Commission, to apprehend and interrogate the Vidyadhara Preceptors implicated in this incident, and recall the former head Yunhua for further investigations.<br><br>...<br>...<br><br><i>\"The Ten-Lords Commission does not have the authority to intervene in the appointment of government officials. Let the Six Charioteers decide on Yunhua on their own. As for the Vidyadhara... there is also very little we can do.

                "Desc": "By the decree of the Ten Lords, we, the judges of the Interrogation Division, have reviewed many records regarding experiences in exorcising heliobi. These findings have been compiled into a comprehensive manual and distributed to the staff. We kindly request that you carefully study the contents of this manual in order to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills for effectively exorcising heliobi.<br><br><b>Q: What is a \"heliobus\"? Why is it not included in the Ten-Lords Commission Standard Exorcism Manual?</b><br><br>A: Heliobi are rare, elusive, and shapeless entities. They are energy-based creatures devoid of a fixed shape, driven by the desire to possess the bodies of sentient beings and exert control over them. Further information regarding heliobi can be found in the <i>List of Archenemies</i>.<br><br>Heliobi re-emerged into the world after the Furnace was damaged. Millennia have passed since their last appearance, which caused the Possession Tragedy. During that era, the inhabitants of the Xianzhou were yet short-life species, and the Ten-Lords Commission had not yet been established. Heliobi have never harmed the Luofu since that Tragedy, and unfortunately, the Ten-Lords Commission has therefore become lax in our vigilance.<br><br>At the time of the distribution of this manual, the Commission has initiated our contingency plan and integrated training on exorcising heliobi into the standard curriculum for judges.<br><br><b>Q: What are their typical behavior patterns and weaknesses?</b><br><br>A: According to ancient manuscripts, heliobi exhibit behaviors akin to swarms of bees. These fiery essences possess the ability to divide and merge, exchanging information and experiences with each other, and enhance their collective strength against adversaries.<br><br>While heliobi that have merged together may still be perceived as individual entities, the conglomerate maintains internal hierarchies (reminiscent of ancient Xianzhou beliefs that attributed three souls and seven spirits within one humans). Within the cluster, certain heliobi specialize in combat, while others engage in contemplation and debate, and the most powerful oversees strategic coordination.<br><br>Most heliobi struggle to cooperate harmoniously with each other due to how they've been tainted by human nature. This weakness can be exploited by posing complex and thought-provoking questions to them, causing them to splinter from within. However, ancient records mention the existence of formidable individual heliobi, such as the Flint Emperor from ancient times and the recent invader, Phantylia, who has been confirmed to have infiltrated the Xianzhou. These individuals possess unwavering self-awareness and, over time, are able to resolve their internal differences and form an indissoluble whole (the heliobi call this process \"fusion\"). Weaker heliobi harbor immense fear of getting close to these great elder beings, for once absorbed, it will equals to the death of the weaker heliobus.<br><br><b>Q: What kind of hosts do heliobi prefer to possess?</b><br><br>A: Heliobi are drawn to individuals with intense desires, those who have undergone profound life experiences, and those harboring many unfulfilled wishes... Hosts possessing such properties are particularly enticing to heliobi due to the abundance of emotions and experiences they contain.<br><br>However, it is worth noting that heliobi do not exhibit discernible preferences when selecting hosts, as evidenced by the distribution of victims in documented cases.<br><br>Notably, heliobi display an aversion to possessing long-life species, considering the Xianzhou peoples \"indigestible\" when interrogated. It can be inferred that the longevity and robust physical resilience of long-life species hinder heliobi's ability to subjugate their hosts' will.<br><br><b>Q: What do heliobi seek through their possession?</b><br><br>A: By possessing their hosts, heliobi tap into the person's experiences and emotions, while also taking control of the person's body to fulfill their own desires. When a heliobus possesses a human host, it adopts the personality and behavioral patterns of that host, leading to the development of a distinct individual awareness that hinders bonding and \"fusion\" with other heliobi.<br><br>Based on our research, it has been observed that heliobi perceive the emotions of their hosts in a manner similar to how humans perceive flavors, such as \"delicious,\" \"sour,\" \"sweet,\" or \"bitter\"... Heliobi possess the ability to easily discern the emotional states experienced by their hosts.<br><br><b>Q: How does heliobus possession negatively affect the host?</b><br><br>A: According to the interview records of the victims, we deduce that once a heliobus has possessed a host, it persistently disrupts the person's nervous system to speak with the host, then exploits the person's inner desires and vulnerabilities to induce hallucinations and provoke emotions.<br><br>Initially, the host would only experience the emergence of an additional presence within their mind, another \"self\" that comprehends them and engages in conversations with them. However, as time passes (typically within a few days), the host will gradually lose the ability to distinguish whether their thoughts arise from their own brain or, instead, originate from the heliobus.<br><br>Subsequently, the host becomes driven to fulfill their deepest desires to the fullest extent, regardless of how audacious or disruptive these may be. Warriors engage in fierce battles endlessly, epicureans indulge in excessive feasting, and the lustful completely surrender to their carnal desires... Under the compulsion of the heliobus, the humans host loses all semblance of self-control and morality, succumbing fully to their innermost desires. This process of gradual insanity is akin to the corruption known as \"mara.\" The Interrogation Division believes this subject is worthy of further research.<br><br>Towards the end of the possession process, the host's body will become completely drained by the heliobus, resulting in sudden spontaneous combustion. This outcome is often fatal for short-life species.<br><br><b>Q: How does one eradicate a heliobus completely?</b><br><br>A: According to the account of our ancestors, there are scant means to completely eradicate a heliobus, with the exception of harnessing its power as an inexhaustible energy source for perpetuity (the Creation Furnace within the Artisanship Commission was constructed for this purpose).<br><br>The most efficacious approach to contend with a heliobus is to confine it within an intangible force field, separating it from other sentient beings. The Ten-Lords Commission will provide the frontline judges and spiritfarers on duty with sacred vessels explicitly crafted for capturing heliobi.<br><br><b>Q: How does one exorcise a heliobus from a possessed host?</b><br><br>A: The conventional technique of exorcism entails applying violence to the host that is suitable in scope and does not result in permanent damage, rendering the physical body incapacitated. In this case, the heliobus, unable to feel the emotions of the host, will naturally depart in search of other prey.<br><br>Nevertheless, it is essential to reiterate that the responsibilities of a judge extend beyond the mere expulsion of malevolent spirits. We work to safeguard the ordinary everyday life of Xianzhou's people. We cannot demand that all judges forsake this method of exorcism, but we must earnestly implore each of you to consider the implications extremely carefully before resorting to such measures.<br><br>Through the examination of successful exorcism cases, we have concluded that when the host becomes cognizant of the heliobus's encroachment and no longer remain obsessed with fulfilling their inner desires, they will have a chance of breaking free from the hallucinatory clutches imposed by the heliobus.<br><br>In rare circumstances, the heliobus may voluntarily relinquish its hold on the host.<br><br>...<br>..."

I fear that it may have fallen to shield-bribes offered by Qlipoth Fort. In order to ensure that our work force receives comprehensive and objective information from every source, I have specifically created this tabloid to openly discuss recent major events. Updates will be monthly but irregular.<br><br>[Topic for this publication: Regarding the IPC aid arrangements]<br><br>One thing that cannot be denied is that without the aid of the IPC, Belobog would be unable to rebuild independently... this I am sure that no one will deny. However, at the same time, the importance of the IPC has been greatly exaggerated. Some people even see them as saviors that have descended from the heavens, as if these people dressed in black are helping us as a form of charity. Here, I would like to rectify this misunderstanding.<br><br>As the time of publication, the IPC has indeed provided services without charge, but that does not mean that they are not benefiting from the situation. Order is the greatest asset, as the holder of order can easily obtain as much as they please. A king can receive the finest food without farming the land, yet the farmers must work to maintain this relationship since their work can only be remunerated when social order is upheld.<br><br>The desire to rule over all is often disguised as a selfless intention to save the people. Since we have connected to the universal market, we will inevitably be molded by the order proposed by the IPC and spend our lives chasing credits for our accounts. As time goes on, we may well have to hollow out every ounce of ore in the ground and bleed our bodies dry just so that certain areas can achieve the high life shown to us in our mobile phones. We cannot allow ourselves to become complacent in gratitude and frivolity. We must remain alert and awake.<br><br>On the other hand, the IPC are outsiders. In their eyes, Jarilo-VI is just an average little planet, no different to every little twinkling star in the sky. However, for us, it is our one and only home. If we become too reliant on the IPC, Belobog will become like a child being led by the hand: Though we feel like we can run and jump, if that guiding hand is taken away, we will soon realize how weak our legs truly are.<br><br>We cannot allow this flow of aid to grow and become a mighty river that will drown our future generations! Though there still remains a great distance between Jarilo-VI and the outside world. This distance can yet be bridged. If we wish to become a respected member of the cosmos, we must forge our own path and not become a vassal of another.<br><br>Fellow workers, go forth and learn. Let us emulate these outsiders and go in search of all that can bring us benefit. This is the only way that our descendants will ever be able to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with other planets, instead of suffering in silence, lost in the undertow."

Before the captain came to his senses, he saw a silver-white battleship approaching, and a voice shouted: \"I am a knight of the Wondergazer, and on their behalf, I shall vanquish you, fiend of evil!\"<br><br>Now you're probably wondering, who is this knight of the Wondergazer and what are his powers? Can he defeat evil against all odds and save the Luofu merchants from a fiery demise? Sorry guests, but you'll have to tune in next time to find out!<br><br>One Versus 300<br>Yukong held her breath and counted out fourteen thieves from the Annihilation Gang who apparently had no fear of death, climbing up the hill silently... As she drew her bow, she didn't bother to open her eyes, instead tracking the thieves by ear. \"Swoosh... swoosh... swoosh\" — the dozen or so scumbags fell to the ground dead, their whole squad obliterated!<br><br>The gang's main camp was alerted of this deed, and hundreds of strange-looking Annihilation Gang members came marching out, their ranks forming a dark mass over the hillside that stretched out from beneath Yukong's feet. The sight of them didn't provoke the slightest hint of fear in her, and she shouted: \"Little scumbags! Come and surrender your lives!\"<br><br>All of our listeners, you tell me — outnumbered three-hundred to one, will Madam Yukong be able to fend off this legion of attackers? Tune in next time to find out!<br><br>Swarm Elimination by 12 Cloud Knights<br>A few Cloud Knights landed and surveyed the situation. Without any hesitation, they gathered the young and strong in the city and said to them:<br><br>\"We are from the Xianzhou Luofu, ordered by the Reignbow Arbiter to cleanse the cosmos of evil. Although the vermin left behind by the Swarm Author is not part of the original plan, it is also our duty to contend with them. As mortal creatures, it is natural to feel timidity in the face of those evil insects. But as humans, how can we succumb to insects and beasts? They should be taught a lesson, so they know who the leader of all living things is!\"<br><br>Can the Cloud Knights defeat the onslaught of the nigh-illimitable Swarm and help the inhabitants of Pomferney rebuild their home planet?<br><br>Heh, don't get ahead of yourself... All will be revealed next time.<br><br>The Slaying of Zulo by Galaxy Rangers<br>We of the Xianzhou Alliance are not the only ones who trust in the Reignbow Arbiter — there is also a group of Galaxy Rangers who are heroes under the Reignbow's command. Their members hail from across the cosmos, and have all kinds of personalities and traits, but each of them are highly skilled, despises evil, and believes in the Arbiter.<br><br>The story goes that in those days, a Lord Ravager named \"Zulo,\" who was under the command of the Ruin Author, led a number of bandits and pirates to scour the universe, leaving destruction and death in their wake.<br><br>It was at this crucial moment that the heroes of the Galaxy Rangers took up arms, shattering Zulo's grand dream of destruction and forcing him to his death in the Swarm!<br>There were countless survivors of the Swarm Author's ranks, armed with mouths that swallowed the sky and teeth that tore through the earth, but without any sentient intelligence. The Galaxy Rangers drove out these insects and beasts, and herded them to attack the fleet of the Lord Ravager.<br><br>What an elaborate method — using the tiger to hunt the wolf! Or you could say, the moth flew straight into the flame!<br><br>A Song to Mourn the Reignbow<br>For millennia the heliobi and Xianzhou fought endlessly, having no care as sworn enemy and foe.<br>Then the Wingweavers descended ten thousand strong, the Xianzhou faced them brave head on.<br>The Wingweavers soar equal to the sky, having built the Muldrasil towering into the stellar void.<br>From ice-cold slumber the Xianzhou woke, a hero of bygone days of old.<br>The hero sought out the Flint Emperor, and to it did speak:<br>\"The mountains and rivers are shaken by the Wingweavers, the Xianzhou and heliobi must cross this bridge hand-in-hand.\"<br>\"You were exiled to the inferno, but now you can join me to cleanse these monsters from our land.\"<br>And so the Flint Emperor was to the hero bound, and the force of their bow shattered stars and earth.<br>Muldrasil was the nest of the mighty Wingweavers, yet the hero enveloped it in flames overall.<br>The Flint Emperor exhausted all their might, and the Wingweavers' wings were scorched beyond flight.<br>The soul of the Xianzhou cried in the face of death, and the hero did not return from their plight.<br>To this day, rivers of blood have been spilled in war.

Afterward, the hero vanished into the unknown until THEY ascended to become the Reignbow Arbiter. THEY then returned and took to protecting Xianzhou till the present.<br><br>This incident is quite peculiar if we look at it now. For Xianzhou citizens who have an average lifespan of 800 years, the war took place only four generations ago, and it can even be considered modern history. Still, the myth of fire deification, which was never proven, is a historical event known by most Xianzhou citizens.<br><br>For a more thorough discussion about this matter, we must talk about the Crisis of Belief that spanned from Year 3400 to 4000 Star Calendar.<br><br>First and foremost, one thing is certain: The title of \"Reignbow Arbiter\" came about earlier than the official appearance of The Hunt as an Aeon. After the hero destroyed the Muldrasil with the Flint Emperor, \"Reignbow Arbiter\" became THEIR title. THEIR original name thus was tabooed and never mentioned in any writings.<br><br>Not long after the hero's \"sacrifice,\" the Null disaster broke out. The little remaining faith the Xianzhou people had in Yaoshi wavered because of the mara-struck. They had to decide whose Path to follow after giving up on the Aeon they once believed in.<br><br>The IPC contacted the Alliance in the first millennium of the Alliance's voyage. Their Preservation beliefs gradually influenced the Xianzhou people. From the way they named the Aeon, we can see that the Reignbow Arbiter is the only Arbiter besides the Firmamend Arbiter. After Merciful Medicus turned into the Plagues Author, many of Xianzhou's peoples naturally decided to follow the Path of Qlipoth, the god of the skywall. They became known as the Firmamend Sect.<br><br>During the 600 years of the Crisis of Belief, the Firmamend Arbiter was once the pillar of the Xianzhou Alliance's beliefs. Although Xianzhou people's faiths have changed drastically by the present, traces of the Firmamend Arbiter can still be seen in the many names of places and buildings leftover from that bygone era, such as the Yaoqing's Amber Avenue, the Luofu's Skywall Delve, and the Zhuming's Firmamend Temple.<br><br>Among the structures, the two most magnificent ones are the Firmamend Temple built by the IPC in the Zhuming and the Amber Palace in Cangcheng. The former is now an affiliated academy of the Zhuming Artisanship Commission, whereas the latter has faded away over time along with Cangcheng, leaving only some videos and a poem by an untraceable author:<br><br>\"From the rails do I perceive the Celestial Hall, and upon clouds can I stride above the leagues of all. In the distance rises the apex of Firmamend high, and the skywall is parted from the peaks mountains though their nearness is nigh.\""

Compared to that Arbiter's worldview, the people of Xianzhou leaned more toward pragmatism when it comes to their preferred spirituality. Therefore, diverse choices of new beliefs bloomed among them.<br><br>Quite a number of people went against the trend and became faithfuls of the Yaoshi. They firmly believed that the behavior of the Denizens of Abundance deviated from Yaoshi's will, and the mara-struck only existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed. These people called themselves Disciples of Sanctus Medicus (hereafter referred to as the \"Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus\" to differentiate them from modern terrorists).<br><br>For a long time in history, the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were not a notorious group. They accepted skepticism with an open mind and built apothecaries to help the poor and needy. For those who had long abandoned Yaoshi beliefs, the behavior of the group was pathetic and laughable, though not particularly detestable.<br><br>Here is something worth mentioning, though the Xianzhou people spared no efforts to diminish it: The predecessor of the Cold Springs Sect, which overhauled the entire Xianzhou healthcare system and stepped onto the historical stage several millennia after the Crisis of Belief, was the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus that existed in secret for thousands of years. In recent years, a group of sorcerers wreaked havoc by impersonating the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Only then did the Cold Springs Sect publish a statement to clarify that they had abandoned the erroneous belief in the Plagues Author.<br><br>Many intellectuals abandoned their old paths for good and chose to follow the Wisdomwalker on the Path of Erudition. They were called the Wisdom Sect. Back then, most Wisdom Sect members preferred to focus on academic research in their ivory towers than spending time on secular matters. Hence, their presence was not felt much during the Crisis of Belief era when the people were spoiled with a plethora of selectable beliefs. (They continued to use the term, \"the Sacrosancts,\" mostly because they attached little importance to the title of Aeons.)<br><br>The Wisdom Sect still exists, although it is hardly know and only has a small group of followers left. The Wisdom Sapientia Academe in the Yuque, which dates back to 5,000 years ago, has provided a constant supply of talented technicians who believe in the Wisdomwalker to various Xianzhou commissions. Not a single Xianzhou person who believes in the Reignbow Arbiter has any issues with the arrangement.<br><br>After all, to most Xianzhou people of sane and pragmatic mind, The Hunt is a righteous path to follow, not a shackle that controls the people. As long as you walk the right path, the Aeon you believe in is just something that helps you achieve your goals."

It's hard to believe there were people who believed in non-Aeon beings in an advanced civilization with a clear understanding of Aeons.<br><br>The historical documents about the followers of these two factions have now become important resources in the field of religious psychology. Many monographs study the psychological mechanisms behind these beliefs, but it is not possible to include their content within the confines of this small document. Here, we will only discuss the most apparent motivation of these believers.<br><br>For those of the Homeward Sect, their faith and loyalty to the Primeval Imperium Emperor was largely just a facade. Their choice of belief was not a philosophical one, but a political one. This is actually quite understandable. Although the Xianzhou people at that time had never been home, their longing to be back never waned.<br><br>So, these homesick people declared, \"We should not continue our voyage alone. Instead, we should answer the call of our emperor and find our way back to our homeland.\"<br><br>After the foxians joined the Xianzhou Alliance, many of them who wished to rebuild their homeland (the Verdantia Sect) merged with the Homeward Sect. Till this day, they remain a political force to be reckoned with. From this incongruous merging, we can see that this style of faith stands as something akin to a slogan for the Homeward Sect (as well as the Verdantia Sect). All they want is to be back in their homeland.<br><br>On the other hand, those of the Flint Emperor Sect looked like they were betting their future on their beliefs. They were convinced that the Flint Emperor would one day become an Aeon, and the only thing that stood in the way of the Flint Emperor's ascendancy was the captivity of the Xianzhou people. If they followed the Flint Emperor firmly, liberated the heliobi, and helped the Flint Emperor become an Aeon, then when the Flint Emperor became the ruler of a Path, they would become the closest mortals to the Aeon and benefit from the power of the Path.<br><br>To no one's surprise, this belief soon led to criminal activity, and those involved were arrested by the relevant authorities. These extremists who supported the Flint Emperor wholeheartedly eventually receded into oblivion.<br><br>The only notable thing about this farce is that the Flint Emperor Sect remained undecided on the Path that the Flint Emperor would rule even until its demise. Some suggested \"Intelligence,\" some proposed \"Flame,\" and even some mentioned \"Grilling,\" which sounded like they would have control over all the grilled meat skewers in the Cosmos."

In fact, almost everyone of the Xianzhou would commemorate the Reignbow's sacrifice in appreciation of what THEY had done for the survival of Xianzhou. But when it came to matters of faith, few of them truly believed that a martyred hero would ascend to become an Aeon and protect the Xianzhou.<br><br>Please allow me to digress and discuss something unrelated to the topic here. Nowadays, many accounts focusing on the discipline history are spreading anxiety on social media about the existence of History Fictionologists, which is highly detrimental to the education of historical knowledge. Among all rumors, the most widely circulated and devastating one is the claim that the Xianzhou Alliance Declaration has been tampered with by History Fictionologists.<br><br>Most of the time, those rumor-mongers will emphasize how the Reignbow Arbiter had yet to become an Aeon when the declaration mentioned: \"From Reignbow to the Ten Lords.\" Now that you have learned about the history behind the \"Reignbow Arbiter\" title, I believe the rumor can be easily debunked.<br><br>Now, back to the topic of the Reignbow Sect. During the Crisis of Belief era, a sect that sincerely believed in the Reignbow Arbiter was not of the public's favor. People preferred to ask for protection from already existing Aeons instead of a non-existing one that could only provide emotional support. Despite being marginalized, the sect did not struggle. They kept praying, anticipating the return of the hero.<br><br>Following the destruction of the Denizens of Abundance's territory by the divine arrow, the people of Xianzhou came to realize that the Reignbow Arbiter truly existed. The Divination Commission, followed by the IPC, the guild, and the other sects, acknowledged the birth of a new Aeon: The Hunt.<br><br>From a fringe group, the Reignbow Sect transformed into a popular sect that could compete with the Firmamend Sect almost overnight.<br><br>The subsequent conflict that transpired was not a religious one, but one to determine the future path of Xianzhou.<br><br>The Firmamend Sect insisted on abiding by the Firmamend Arbiter's will and was strongly against Xianzhou's involvement in the war with the Denizens of Abundance. The Reignbow Sect opined that hiding and defending is not enough to fend off the Denizens of Abundance. For the survival of the Alliance, only by following the Path of The Hunt and cleansing the enemy could the future be secured.<br><br>Following consecutive victorious expeditions, the numerous appearances of the Reignbow, and the joining of the foxian and Vidyadhara, the Reignbow Sect slowly gained traction among the people. In Year 4100, the Reignbow Arbiter became the undisputed main Aeon of the Xianzhou Alliance.<br><br>Just like that, the Crisis of Belief came to an end, and the era of the Reignbow Arbiter began."

To express my sincerity, I will give a brief explanation in a manner that is understandable to the Guild.<br><br>I believe the Guild is aware that the Chaos System is an insurmountable hurdle when it comes to predicting the future. All predictions boil down to predictions on a certain type of Chaos, but Chaos itself is unpredictable. Any tiny disturbances, whether caused by changes in weather or the three-body problem, may result in fatal deviations in the prediction outcomes.<br><br>The creators of Matrix of Prescience Ultima sought inspiration from the Wisdomwalker and used the idea to predict the future: There is a constant and conclusive disturbance factor behind all predictions — the observation itself. To put it simply, when we are observing a Chaos System, our observation itself will affect the final operation of the system.<br><br>Now, if we treat the observation as a variable (as in observing our observations), we can derive an outcome that is as accurate as possible.<br><br>Well, that is what the creators planned to do initially. When they put the amazing machine to use, something beyond everyone's comprehension occurred.<br><br>The phenomenon is described more accurately in the attachment with the use of more precise mathematical terms, but I will give a simple explanation here (which may be inaccurate): When the Matrix of Prescience Ultima observes an observation, the future it observes will come toward us and reveal itself from Chaos, though it only has a rough framework.<br><br>Or let us explain it less rigorously in terms of physics: When we don't observe the future, the future that has not happened does not exist, just like the past that has happened. But if we observe the future, the future will happen in the way we observe it.<br><br>Let me be more straightforward here — the way the Matrix of Prescience Ultima operates is like a black box. We know that we can derive a frighteningly accurate prediction from the Chaos system by \"observing our observation,\" but no one knows how it works nor can anyone explain it.<br><br>Many, including my colleagues from the Divination Commission, consider this to be an example of how humans can change or select the future with their own power. But for me... I will interpret this from another perspective...<br><br>The past, present, and future do not exist sequentially across the axis of time, but all exist simultaneously. (This statement of mine essentially denied the existence of time, so the concepts of \"sequential\" and \"simultaneous\" might be slightly inappropriate here.)

Unfortunately, the place could no longer accommodate vast numbers of tourists in recent years and even stopped issuing new travel passes briefly due to the damage inflicted by the third Abundance War. Now that the new travel policy is in place, we can visit the beautiful waters of the Miniature Myriads again.<br><br>According to the regional policy, a Xianzhou Alliance Travel Pass and a Fanghu Travel Pass, which has to be applied two to three months in advance, are required to travel in the Fanghu. The same rules apply to Xianzhou citizens. Those whose residency papers are under the jurisdiction of the Xianzhou Alliance are required to provide the certificate of conduct issued by the Realm-Keeping Commission of their domicile to the Sky-Faring Commission of the Fanghu. Travelers from other worlds are required to provide the certificate of conduct issued by their place of residence and the certificate of no criminal record issued by the IPC.<br><br>The procedure is slightly complicated, but the travel pass issued by the Fanghu's Sky-Faring Commission is valid for 20 years, so you do not have to repeatedly go through the process.<br><br>Please note that the Fanghu is an autonomous dominion of the Vidyadhara, thus it has different customs, culture, and social structures from other Xianzhou ships. Please purchase a copy of the Fanghu Lifestyle Guide from the Star-Picking Tours before departure to avoid unintended mistakes.<br><br>Xianzhou Fanghu Must-see Attractions<br><br>[Claretgleam Bay]<br><br>The Claretgleam Bay in the Sanze Delve is the first stop for most travelers who visit the Fanghu. Many are immediately impressed by the water that flows peacefully on top of the dome of the delve the moment they disembark from their starskiffs. Many might have already witnessed this scene through an immersia or hologram before their arrival but let there be no doubt — nothing beats seeing it with your very own eyes.<br><br>Look up and admire the sea! You will see the Shangguan Sea Snakes gliding past with their massive bodies, the Lantern Fish sparkling like fireflies when they huddle together, and the Srimanth Conches hunting for schools of fish like nimble missiles... The Claretgleam Bay is arguably the only place in the Cosmos that can offer you such a mind-blowing experience.<br><br>[Reignbow's Road Museum]<br><br>The Reignbow's Road Museum is located in the East Sea Delve. Its name in full is \"Third Abundance War Reignbow's Road Museum.\" As the entire East Sea Delve was razed to the ground during the war, the museum was built upon the ruins.<br><br>In Reignbow's Road Museum, you will get to watch a holographic History of Reignbow's Road formed using the Vidyadhara's cloudhymn magic. During this immersive experience, you will witness how the catastrophe took place and learn how the Abundance Axis launched an aggressive attack against the Fanghu, and how the Pearlkeepers put up a tenacious defense, but to no avail as the Abundance Axis managed to invade the delve in the end. To prevent further destruction, the Reignbow Arbiter appeared to wipe out the fleet of the Abundance Axis with divine arrows and annihilated many corrupted delves. Among them, East Sea Delve was the only one that was simply \"reduced to ruins.\"<br><br>The most stunning exhibition hall in the museum is none other than the Palace of Mortal World, where the Fanghu and IPC have built a replica of Moundfish Avenue, the busiest area in East Sea Delve before the war. The daily lives of the 39,823 residents is manifested in the form of Mirage Echoes showing their comings and goings prior to the disaster. If you chat with them, you will realize that they are ordinary people just like you who probably also never expected they would perish during the war.<br><br>Reignbow's Road Museum offers free entry to travelers as the citizens of Fanghu want to show more people the purpose behind the Xianzhou Alliance's endeavors.<br><br>[Wild Shore]<br><br>The Wild Shore is the most renowned beach in the Fanghu. Despite the complicated travel pass application procedure, the attraction still welcomes almost 70 million travelers every year.<br><br>The biggest appeal of the Wild Shore is that it is both a hot spring and a beach. The water there is rich in microbes beneficial for the health of one's skin, and the shore is blessed with a magnificent stretch of white sand and beautiful natural scenery. However, its extreme popularity is its most significant drawback, so much so that you will only get to admire the beach during the off-season, when the sands are not literally covered with the bodies of tourists."

Considering that the Yaoqing is often sailing through active war segmenta, you are advised to prepare more safety measures before departure. If you are interested, you can sign up for the Yaoqing tour with Star-Picking Tours.<br><br>Many travelers have contacted us to ask if it is safe to travel to Xianzhou Yaoqing. We completely understand your concern.<br><br>However, please do not worry, as the military operations of the Yaoqing is mainly done by the expeditionary fleet and will not endanger the main ship. Of course, that doesn't mean the Denizens of Abundance are not constantly fixated on their need to eradicate this \"catastrophe,\" but rest assured, for no enemies have ever managed to deal any substantial damage to the Yaoqing's main ship since the last Amber Era.<br><br><i>(Having said that, it is still vital for travelers to strictly abide by the Yaoqing's regulations during the trip.

The place commemorates how the previous Caelorum Venti, high elder of the Yaoqing, fought valiantly and slew a herd abomination named the Hundred Hands.<br><br>It took the Artisanship Commission of the Yaoqing and 3,000 Vidyadhara craftsmen more than 20 years to build the pavilion with large slabs of jade and moonstone. It is hailed as the epitome of the Yaoqing Vidyadhara architectural style, as no language can describe its exquisiteness and grandeur adequately. Vidyadhara Windsayers have laid a \"Feather Path\" in the pavilion that links 16 floating islands together to allow people to walk freely in the air without any flying or floating equipment.<br><br>Please follow the rules and regulations of the Caelorum Venti Pavilion during your visit. We will not be responsible for mishaps that occur due to violations of the rules and regulations.<br><br>[Verdantia Harbor]<br><br>At the Verdantia Harbor in the Verdantia Delve, we will get a glimpse of the Yaoqing's unique starskiff manufacturing process.<br><br>The guide will take visitors through the entire place to see how those furry little creatures grow to become loyal partners of the Verdant Knights that are capable of eradicating demons.<br><br>New starskiffs are born almost every day. With the help of the staff, you will have the chance to deliver a new starskiff and experience the miracle of biotechnology. You might even get to name the new starskiff, which will be seen eliminating Denizens of Abundance on the battlefield and fighting for the survival of the entire Cosmos in a few short months.<br><br>[Red Fox Theater]<br><br>After a long day filled with exciting and touching moments, it is time to engage in some elegant and soothing activities for a change of mood. You will get to enjoy the most authentic and traditional \"Pacify Play\" in Red Fox Theater on Baiheng Street.<br><br>Pacify Play is a traditional theater performance of the Yaoqing foxians. Be prepared to be blown away by the vast circular stage when you set foot in the theater. Red Fox Theater is one of the few that rejects the use of special effects to preserve their millennium-old traditions. They indeed need a large stage to be able to showcase all elements of the play.<br><br>This type of traditional opera uses different types of facial makeup to differentiate the characters and their personalities, so it requires some prior knowledge to be able to understand the story. Still, you will have no problem experiencing the charm of the play as it boasts super-realistic stage combat scenes where dozens of actors will find themselves moving around in midair, or acting out gunfights and physical struggles."

At the time, he was dressed in what could only be termed as suspicious — a huge hood over his purple face mask, and a massive backpack strapped to his back completely out of kilter with the rest of his body. He hid among the refugees, quietly peddling some wares of unknown origin — like weapons from interstellar pirates.<br><br>I struck up a conversation with him, and this man hardly kept his secrets to himself — not only did he flog some weapons to me, but he even promised to offer me some \"mods.\" In other words, weapons mods. I was vigilant at the time, as my professional instincts were screaming at me that this person wasn't a good bloke. But I couldn't stop myself from asking more questions.<br><br>He grumbled to me about being considered a \"profiteer\" by the refugees around him. \"To support my family, I came here without even taking out any life insurance. Is my life really that worthless? I came here to help everyone.\" He pointed to eggshells on the ground, telling me how some loose refugees would even pelt him with eggs and how his \"kindness\" had not gotten the respect it deserved.<br><br>I asked about the price of wares (mainly those weapons of his), and indeed they were surprisingly expensive. Probably not many refugees could afford that. When asked about this, he retorted \"An optimist invests in the future. It's no use worrying about money, because if you don't use it now, you'll sure be spending it in the future...\" This guy keeps having this grim sneer, and it's starting to creep me out.<br><br>Leaving the refugee camp, I reported him to the Realm-Keeping Commission. Unregulated market operations are always a violation of laws and ethics. Based on the report from the Realm-Keeping Commission, the black market dealer should've been caught.<br><br>And yet the past few days, I've been seeing him again over at Aurum Alley.<br><br>Black Market Dealer Investigative Notes (II)<br><br>Ever since I started working for the press, I've grown particularly sensitive to gray market operations, and I couldn't help myself from getting to the truth.<br><br>This guy was dressed completely differently from last time, but his movements were a dead giveaway. Seeing me draw closer, he also recognized me from before and started to banter again. At first, I was worried he was going to take revenge on me... Then I realized I was worrying too much — this guy had never taken a stint in prison seriously.<br><br>He said the Xianzhou had been a mess recently, and he'd sniffed out a chance to sell medicinal materials — none other than vines grown from mara-struck victims... He was going to peddle it to Outworlders seeking everlasting life! I was shocked... Could that really be used as medicine? Would it work? This wicked black market dealer and his demented blasphemy... If I wrote an exposé, would he be condemned? No, I'd better ask instead whether or not he'd make it off the Xianzhou alive...<br><br>Thinking about all this filled my heart with the power of justice.

Unfortunately, this streamer (y'know, the one with red hair? I dunno if she's from the Xianzhou, but she seems to know everything about the Xianzhou) made the place go viral with her videos, so it was packed out with people and doing great business. I barely got a table when I came, and had to wait so long.<br><br>The menu squeezed so many options onto it that it was really hard to order. My breathing sped up and I started to have a panic attack when I looked at the menu. But whatever I ended up ordering, it was delicious.<br><br>Really, it was so delicious that I couldn't really think of any more adjectives to describe it. Every bite off the fork (sorry, I haven't mastered the art of using chopsticks yet! But luckily they have other cutlery) was its own surprise. The Garlic-infused Pork was yum, the Granny Chen's Tofu was yum, and the Crisped Melon and Diced Chicken was yum, too. Every dish was so delicious and it felt like I was exploring new flavor sensations in my mouth over and over again. It's hard to imagine what kind of beast the meat here is cut from. Definitely super fresh and gamy, but also hearty.<br><br>The Chili Oil Beef Offal Stew was unforgettable — the real meaning of a \"master chef.\" You could see the boss lady (who is also the head chef) personally performing knife work, whizzing to slice perfect strips of beef offals. Here, the chili oil slowly boiled soaked into the beef offal just so. I meant to ask the boss lady whether she was five thousand years old or something, seeing as I heard everyone on the Xianzhou lives so long. She must have honed that knife technique of hers over thousands of years. Otherwise, she must be a martial master with the knife that conceals her fame in this ordinary place!<br><br>Different from Starskiff Haven, Aurum Alley's feeling is strange and very deceptive — just like its name, I have no idea why \"aurumatons\" would lend their name to this district. Spices Supreme is the same: It looks normal enough just walking by. But inside it's sparkling clean, and the boss lady is friendly and scrupulous as she cooks up a meal. There're meatballs from some beast called \"999 Handmade Meatballs,\" and the boss lady insists on pounding out the mincemeat 999 times before me, promising me this method is the real deal. Luckily, I'm not running a kitchen back home. Otherwise, I would chew them out like, \"See, you guys are all chefs, right? Why is there such a big gap in skil!?\"<br><br>All in all, I'm very satisfied with everything about this place. If you want to try fresh, special and unique Xianzhou meals, I highly recommend you give this place a go. This restaurant absolutely deserves a 5-star rating!"

Going on about how \"If I ne'er live to see the crystal palace of Thalassa\" or \"Ne'er live to see Pier Point\" or \"Ne'er live to see Planet Screwllum\"... Basically, everywhere she praised probably has sights worth seeing. And if it's on the Alliance's turf, then there's nothing stopping a pilot from going there.<br><br>But before I was forced to visit, the Xianzhou Zhuming has always been a place I thought was better avoided — why? It's because of the preconceived ideas I held, thinking that it is a blazing hot furnace constantly on fire everywhere.<br><br>It's drilled into us from day one at the Sky-Faring Commission that \"fire beats fur every time.\" A key part of being a foxian pilot involves spraying ourselves with fire retardant gel before each sortie. So, I have pretty good reasons to be scared of the Zhuming, right?<br><br>But the day of my mission to the Zhuming inevitably arrived. The Yaoqing's Heroncrest Fleet was tied up in conflict against the Denizens of Abundance in proximity to Owenley and other closeby planets, stalling their main forces. The Military Affairs Office put me into a delegation with another dozen people and stuffed us into a Navis Astriger headed for the Zhuming to request arms and reinforcements.<br><br>Through the porthole, I bore witness for the first time this huge furnace — no, it had nothing to do with any kind of furnace at all. The Xianzhou Zhuming was like an intricately-carved golden lotus, gradually unfolding its lustrous leaves around the cone-shaped central hull, bathed blue under the light of an azure star. It was peaceful and tranquil.<br><br>\"Is this... also a Xianzhou ship? This is nothing like those Flying Skyboats we've learned in the Guild's records.\" The exchange scholar from the Intelligentsia Guild next to me looked at me half-astounded, half-curious, as she vocalized just what I was thinking.<br><br>\"Yeah, seems like the craftmasters who built this ship were not only liberal in form, but also liberal in definition.\" I laughed. After all, it has been over seven thousand years since those huge migrant vessels set sail, and the residents have completely transformed them beyond all recognition. (There's a similar concept in philosophy. What is it called again? The Ship of Polka? No, the Ship of Screwseus?)<br><br>I don't blame her, though. People always form preconceived notions about places they've never been to. I'm no different, right?<br><br>In my imagination, the Zhuming was this big clumsy furnace, with sparks spattering everywhere and muscular craftsmen smashing their blacksmith hammers down — I'm sorry.

The vast starskiff platform seemed to be entirely chiseled out of a single block of moonstone so big that it disappeared over the horizon. Even more astonishing was the seamless integration of the structure's frame into the port — as if it was an array of metal organically sprouting from the minerals below.<br><br>Without a doubt, this proud and blatant display of craftsmanship was sculpted deliberately to debunk any biased ideas Outworlders might have formed before they arrived on the Zhuming.<br><br>And the person that the Artisanship Commission leader sent to welcome our delegation was a little kid barely in his teens.<br><br>\"M—Master Huaiyan sent me here to receive you...\"<br><br>This shy and juvenile voice and the lack of pointy ears showed no possibility of him being a \"child-looking elder,\" a Vidyadhara with delayed physical development.

I spent a lot of time buttering up this shy kid on the way before I learned of his background (he seemed a little insecure, but kids would always need a little encouragement before opening up to you).<br><br>Just as Elixir Seekers rush to the Luofu in a neverending stream, so too is the Zhuming up there with Pier Point and Screwllum for craft apprentices (or any other holy sites for manufacturing excellence that I may not be aware of). Countless Outworlders come to the Zhuming from all over the cosmos to study skills, and most return to their homelands afterward to disseminate those learnings. But not Yingxing. He has no homeland to which he may return.<br><br>His homeland was destroyed by the borisin and transformed into one of their weapons nurseries. I knew what that meant. This kid's family will become literal pieces of meat with no dignity, nutrient to those mountainous mechabeasts. And upon arriving at the Xianzhou, so fresh from escaping the clutches of death, this child pledged to strive toward one goal and one goal only: To learn how to make weapons for the Cloud Knights to root out those terrifying and malicious monsters. He was incredible at his work, earning his accolades, and now entitled to be called a craftsman at such a young age.<br><br>\"However... Other celestial masters tell me I've still got a long way to go.\"<br>\"It's not that I'm lacking in enthusiasm or motivation...\"<br>\"It's just that I can't keep living on and on like they can...

Their achievements are still glorious enough to shake the entire cosmos. What difference does it make to your achievements, whether you're a long-life or a short-life species?\"<br>\"Just focus on what you want to do, and let fate take its course.\"<br><br>The kid seemed to have a brighter expression on his face. Suddenly, he shook his head once more. \"But I shouldn't ignore everything said by those old guys! Master Huaiyan... He respects me a lot, and has taught me a lot, too!\"<br><br>Such vengeance bestowed by cruel fate, such a piteous backstory, and such precocious endowment... I couldn't help but pat the kid on the head. But he seemed to see right through me in a second, covering up my hand with his own smaller one and patting it in comfort.

My master urged me to take you on a visit to the Flamewheel Forge.\"<br>\"Should we get down to business and talk about the reinforcements and weapons first?\"<br>\"I... I'm just passing on Master Huaiyan's orders.\"<br><br>\"Forges wrought a million stars bright, irons craft heroes' soaring flight. Miniscule lights into martial might made, only with sharp blades are peace and plenty saved.\" These verses hang in adornment in the main hall of the Flamewheel Forge.<br><br>The Records of the Early Nation showed that an unknown emperor of the Primeval Imperium days once gifted the master craftsman of the Zhuming, Yang Di, with a weapons-casting mold in honor of its maiden voyage. To this day it remains, passed down through the ages to be pride of place in the palace. Some sixty or seventy percent of all the Xianzhou's armory comes from the artisans of the Zhuming — and the Flamewheel Forge is the foundational base of the Zhuming's Artisanship Commission, in which we stood.<br><br>My peers on the trip were perplexed by this strange arrangement. Had Huaiyan brought us here to show off how precious his forged weapons were, and to use that as a bargaining chip with the Yaoqing? Did he send a kid because he was planning on rejecting us?<br><br>The thought of possibly engaging in debates made me irritable. You can't just go complainin' on somebody else's turf — that's something my great-grandma always taught me to save my hide.

He produced a piece of paper, casually folding it into the shape of a bird and with a few words, it flew off swiftly, wings flapping. Moments later, the ground shook all around the hall as if some device had been activated, and sounds as loud as a landslide could be heard. The curved walls of the hall rapidly began to separate and shrink, and gradually all that remained beneath our feet was the base of the hall.

There are even winged humanoids, with their wings outstretched...<br>— Through my earphones, I hear the howl of Cloud Knight from inside starskiff and transport vehicles moments before they crash, \"Defend the Xianzhou!\" \"Victory to the Cloud Knights!\"...<br>— A colossal aurumaton, towering hundreds of meters high as it stalks and strides, stretching out cold metal arms to duel a giant gelatinous beast of meat, teeth, and countless eyeballs.<br>— In the sky stand radiant warriors, holding spears and longbows radiating fiery death. Their every gene seem to have been sculpted and filtered to grant them a strength and beauty surpassing that of modern Xianzhou people.<br>— Even more terrifying is that their bodies are covered in an unnatural flame, as if embodying their innermost courage and rage. They charge one-by-one, over and over into the formless void, never to return...<br><br>\"...Take this oath, and keep it forever!\" The rays of light roared, leaving my ears ringing.<br><br>\"Everyone! Steel yourselves — and don't look directly at the Flint Emperor!\"<br><br>A voice like the ferocious clap of thunder resounded above the main hall. Someone stomped a heavy staff into the floor, and after the metal hum subsided, it was like an invisible barrier rose up to swiftly block out the light beams and projections filling the hall — sending it back to its original quiet state. All awoke from their state of confusion.<br><br>The master of the Flamewheel Forge, also the longest-lived human aboard the Xianzhou, a master among craftsmasters — Huaiyan, had finally arrived.<br><br>\"I told my apprentice to bring you all here for a talk about weapons and support. I didn't think he would forget to cover up this Pseudo Sun, and nearly got you all stupefied. The fault is entirely my own, and I apologize to each and every one of you.\"<br><br>Huaiyan strode with mountainous steps up the staircase that appeared from thin air. Gradually, he arrived before us.<br><br>\"I have received Helm Master Qingying's request. The Yaoqing is having trouble fighting off the enemy, and the Zhuming can't just stand by idly and watch from the sidelines.\"<br><br>But — there has to be a \"but\" incoming — when faced with attack from a formidable foe or a need to recuperate, every Xianzhou retains their own right to decide whether or not to send reinforcements. What reason will he give to turn down this request of ours?<br><br>\"The Zhuming wants not for arms. I will allocate you three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives based on Qingying's request. But we, the Zhuming, have our own hands full with eradicating filth.\"<br><br>\"So as for reinforcements, I can give you a number equal to the size of your delegation!\"<br><br>...<br>..."

There is an ocean as far as the eye can see — covering up the entire planetary surface.<br><br>Our ancestors lived a carefree life together in the Roiling Deep with countless other living things.<br><br>Back then, we could still use the power gifted to us by our dragon ancestor, Long. As the prime species among sea life in the Roiling Deep, everything was under our control. If a fish species was too bony, we'd remove the bones from inside their body. If a sea beast was too small, we'd fatten it up and make it proliferate. And if a seaweed was too bitter, we'd sweeten it until it was delicious.<br><br>My teacher says that back then, we could use our powers derived from Long to change the form of any creature, as easily as children playing with modeling clay. Our ancestors could modify fish into a thick mountain of meat and gouge meat from this mountainous mass whenever they wanted a bite to eat. Back then, crabs could have thousands of legs, each leg filled with delicious crab meat.<br><br>I wish that we could go back to those days, but my teacher says that we can never return.<br><br>One day, when we could no longer control the powers of our dragon ancestor, all of the creatures in the entire ocean became our enemies. The fish were toxic, the sea beasts hostile, and even the seaweed could prey upon us. Later on, even the microscopic creatures in the Roiling Deep became dangerous. They multiplied until the oceans were no longer fit for our survival.<br><br>Even later on, we became a member of the Xianzhou Alliance. Life is good aboard the Xianzhou, but the freedom of the ocean is something we will never know again.<br><br>But my teacher also says that people should live with the future in mind, and we shouldn't suffocate ourselves with nostalgia.

They've started reducing the number of Xianzhou exchanges and while I'm too lazy to argue with them, I have to admit that they do have a point. Indeed, there really is little commercial use for the study of folk histories alone, and nobody can squeeze any value out of the Xianzhou people...<br><br>After all these years of academic research, I've finally begun to feel my enthusiasm and determination waning... No, they're completely exhausted, and that's worse than running out of funding. But now the question is: What am I going to do? Money's running thin, and manpower is tight... That guy Todd's just started a family, and I can't fork out for any overtime. What a junk topic this is, cracking the secret of immortality...

It'd only be enough for extra garlic.<br><br><i>*Several entry dates remain unfilled*</i><br><br>[Week ██]<br><br>I nearly starved to death wandering lost around the streets of Starskiff Haven. A Vidyadhara brother treated me to a hot meal. I have to say that they really do as a people have tremendous taste. After chatting for a while, I feel like I've had a revelation that I haven't quite yet figured out...<br><br><s>Should I persist? Or should I leave the Xianzhou with everyone else?<br>No matter what, I know that I have to stay positive and optimistic about things. I have to believe in myself. I have to believe that I can find the secret of eternal youth.</s><br>I'm tired, so very tired.

I learned that some tribes' myths of \"fountain of youth\" and \"secret underwater kingdoms\" share similarities with the Vidyadhara legends that ███ told me. But any connection between them remains to be seen. Especially the \"past events\" about the Vidyadhara which ███ said — well, they regard it as memories past, so it should be an oral history passed down through generations. I've never heard of such a thing, and the Guild has no such record either. A daring idea now tugs at my gray matter...<br><br>Weekly work plan:<br>1. Check over Vidyadhara materials √<br>2.

Next, they'll probably devote full resources to researching the secret of foxian tails. <br>But it won't amount to anything. Growing fluffy ears and a tail means there's a risk of uncontrollable growth, and their lifespan isn't very long — meaning their cellular vigor is severely limited.

I'd heard of such oral histories, but never expected so many physical ruins to remain. He also agrees with my views on recorded history: The past is more than just a random memory. It must be recorded in writing so that more people can witness the glory of days gone by.<br><br>...The retro-natal ecosystem of the Vidyadhara is really interesting. Just soaking in these pools leaves me feeling a whole lot younger... And as for this auto-incubation method of theirs...<br><br>...I got a tube of Vidyadhara egg extract and to be honest, I was worried that my needle wouldn't penetrate their \"eggshells.\" On the way back, I ran into a vehicle checkpoint at the Starskiff Haven which freaked me out — but luckily, I wasn't exposed.<br><br>Sure enough, the Guild has launched their new genetic sequencing project. There's not much time left for me.<br><br>[Week ██]<br><br>I wrote a few times to hurry up that kid Todd. He said he was all ready to go, but I'm guessing that he'll be too late.<br>I guess I'll have to do this myself, then.<br><br>[Week ██]<br><br>...My skin has recovered its elasticity, and I have more hair in my follicles. The latter is actually a pleasure. I never thought that I'd be able to solve this thorny genetic problem along the way. If I can do it, then this alone would be incredible.<br><br>I'm still not sure when the cellular vigor can reach normal Vidyadhara levels, but based on hair follicle regeneration results I believe that it already may have happened.<br><br>[Week ██]<br><br>Once enough growth has occurred, it stops — and the next growth stage doesn't perform as well.<br>The █████ concentration is also below average, which I take to be a sign of insufficient extraction.<br>I've talked with ███ and planned on visiting the Scalegorge Waterscape with him sometime later.

On this day, each Xianzhou ship stages a grand gala festival that is simulcast across all friendly factions in the universe. Best wishes are sent between ships using the Yellowbell Resonance System, and each delve also holds its own uproarious party.<br><br>On this day, every household in the Xianzhou Alliance will pre-cook berrypheasant eggs, each shell intricately engraved with gorgeous patterning that symbolizes auspice. Perhaps back in the olden days, the Xianzhou people would engrave these eggshells themselves, but over the generations, people gradually began to buy up machine-engraved eggs instead.<br><br>The Fire Taboo Festival certainly seems lively to Outworlders, but there are also some strange restrictions to follow: No fireworks may be lit, no non-essential fires may be started, hot food is forbidden, and even the mention of the word \"fire\" is to be avoided.<br><br>During this time, the Xianzhou people spare no effort in explaining how the Fire Taboo Festival commemorates those who passed during the Flaming Catastrophe in the Heliobi* Wars. It also celebrates the great hero who burned themselves to cinders to save the Xianzhou alongside the Flint Emperor (legend has it the hero would later be known as the Reignbow Arbiter). In honor of these heroes, the Xianzhou people have chosen a day to avoid anything to do with fire (that is, the heliobi fire-spirits).<br><br><i>Note: I am unsure what parasites of pure energy such as heliobi are called on other planets. The Intelligentsia Guild records at the Astral Ecology School call these formless creatures \"Spirits of Light,\" \"Formless Fiendfire,\" or \"Soul Possessor.\"</i><br><br>This sounds like a plausible origin story. The only problem is that the Fire Taboo Festival pre-dates the Heliobi Wars and even pre-dates the Xianzhou Alliance itself. This extremely ancient tradition can be traced back to even before the days of the Xianzhous' launch.<br><br>The tradition of eating cold foods and avoiding fire is an ancient one among humans. Similar festivals occur on most human-occupied planets that exhibits seasons (despite the lack of actual seasons aboard any Xianzhou ships, the tradition remains). Comparing the festivals of these different civilizations reveals certain interesting commonalities.<br><br>On Stockirk, fires are banned for seven days before the start of planting seasons, and only cold meals are eaten. Legend has it, this commemorates a hero who fought off invaders but was burned alive for treason after the enemy won. It was not until fifty years later that she was finally exonerated.<br><br>On Tamagawajosui, fire is banned after the end of the cold season, and only cold meals are eaten (a custom which has disappeared following extensive urbanization there). It's said that this commemorates the 23 farmers and the county magistrate who died from hunger strikes against taxation.<br><br>On New Seljuk-7, fire isn't banned until Chunfen, but plenty of fowl eggs are boiled up (just as on the Xianzhou) to eat on the day of the festival. This is another legacy symbol of switching hot with cold foods. This is said to commemorate a loyal patriot who was killed by a treacherous official.<br><br>It's clear to see that all of these festivals — including the Fire Taboo Festival — are ultimately ceremonies to worship spring's arrival, with its longer days and shorter nights. The banning of fire is to revere the natural stars that shift with the seasons, and bird eggs are eaten to symbolize those stars (as these eggs tend to be round and nurture life, of which progeny can fly, and whose birdsongs welcome the sun).<br><br>In fact, despite the various festivals around the universe, if we trace back the origins to their source, we can see that the ancients were really only interested in three things: When the sun shines, when the rain falls, and who died in injustice.<br><br>In all kinds of historical literature, literati and historians have spared no efforts in constructing such a narrative: A hero who was framed for fighting corruption during the Theophany Era, was later freed and fought alongside the Flint Emperor to launch a self-sacrificial attack on the Wingweavers — and THEY later ascended to become the Reignbow Arbiter.<br><br>Let's put aside these academic disputes about the origins of Reignbow Arbiter for now, and discuss a rather simple question: Why is it that people choose to transpose good heroes who died unjust deaths onto these ancient existing festivals?<br><br>The answer is simple. When faced with tyrannical, deceitful, and manipulative forces that can alter and shroud historical record with misinformation, the general public seems helpless. And yet mortals can wield a very mortal weapon: The re-writing of heroic deeds into songs of metaphorical justice, which are then interlaced into rituals of the sun and the rain, recasting them into a brand-new allegory.<br><br>This is how the powerful are prevented from banning the passing down of such a righteous song — unless they could extinguish the very stars, evaporate the very rains, stop the very seasons from changing themselves, and stop the very birds from singing out."

The Sky-Faring Commission personnel who were originally accompanying us were unable to split their attention anymore and could no longer \"enthusiastically\" take care of me. She must have relaxed her guard against an old man like me who is weak and inactive.<br><br>Anyway, how does the saying go in Xianzhou? \"Taking chestnuts out of the fire\"? Risk and benefit are good, inseparable friends. Anyway, I dispatched a new acquaintance of mine, a certain investigator. {F#She}{M#He} did not disappoint me and brought me a sample of a plant. This branch is not grown in a garden or an incubator, but is an abnormal growth extracted from a fallen Xianzhou warrior (may Qlipoth watch over all afflicted souls!).<br><br>I risked being arrested and drove a starskiff to explore several delves. During that time, I witnessed some Cloud Knights falling into an uncontrollable frenzy. They seemed to have broken down from some great pain and brandished their weapons at their colleagues for no reason. Within minutes, some of these soldiers started having vines and leaves sprouting out from under their armor, as if they were some plant in a frenzied growth spurt. Some even lost their human form.<br><br>As I mentioned in my previous report, the Xianzhou myth about the \"Ambrosial Arbor\" is not just talk. The sacred tree, believed to have been planted by Yaoshi, suddenly began to grow — the reason for which will take some time to ascertain. The rise of the Ambrosial Arbor brought about many anomalies, the most notable of which is the madness known to the Xianzhou people as \"mara-struck,\" as well as the strange growths that only appear on the bodies of Xianzhou natives.<br><br>I don't have many tools at hand, but spectral analysis and genetic testing show that these \"plants\" do not belong to a simple biological category. They are more like a kind of bionic material. I extracted some liquid from their vascular system, which contains Xianzhou native genes (you don't lack samples, but you certainly haven't obtained this kind of mutant sample).<br><br>Attached is the report on the test data, which can be opened with my Intelligentsia Guild membership code.

                "Desc": "...<br>...<br><br>Beyond the Cloud Knights, the existence of the Ten-Lords Commission has always been a great concern before taking any action.<br><br>Although everyone on Xianzhou knows the name of the Ten-Lords Commission, no one knows where its base is, who controls it, or how many members it has. Even though there are written records like the <i>Ten-Lords Commission's Book of Imprisonment</i> that can be consulted, ordinary people might not even know that this office is not included in the Six Commissions.<br><br>An opponent who openly bears arms can be guarded against. However, an opponent like the Ten-Lords Commission, who seems familiar but is actually mostly unknown, is truly terrifying. Its nebulous status proves that its members blur people's cognition of them further using some unknown means.<br><br>I must ascertain the details before taking further action... but unfortunately, time is running out.<br><br>...<br>...<br><br>Spiritfarer<br><br>Rumor has it that, before the people of the Xianzhou fall into mara, the spiritfarers would come to guide them. Such rumors have always portrayed them as messengers of death with the ability to foresee the future and always appearing at the right time, but this is entirely groundless.<br><br>The large number of mara-struck victims that I witnessed, testified for, and even dissected, proves that even the spiritfarers are powerless to deal with this phenomenon. It is only when it comes to collecting the remains and determining the cause of death that all the documents and research results disappear without a trace, as if swallowed by an invisible black mouth.<br><br>Who are the spiritfarers? Where are they recruited from? What is their salary? Are they flesh and blood, or ingenium marionettes? Will they also be afflicted with mara like all Xianzhou natives?<br><br>There are no answers.<br><br>...<br>...<br><br>Judge<br><br>As the saying goes, \"Better to lose gold and jade than to enter the Shackling Prison. Better to suffer disaster than to face a judge.\"<br><br>When a judge appears, the cycranes all malfunction and ignore their commands, so none can capture their image. But I have collected many more eyewitness accounts of the judges than of the spiritfarers. Perhaps their appearance signifies that things have deteriorated to an irreparable point, and their commotion and traces are so conspicuous that they cannot be concealed.<br><br>According to reliable eyewitness accounts, the judges are responsible for capturing, subduing — and when necessary, killing — the long-life species that violate the Ten Unpardonable Sins in the <i>Xianzhou Legal Code</i>. Such targets are extremely dangerous, so the judges possess incredible instruments of punishment and sorcery, far superior to the Cloud Knights' weapons and armor. A sister among the disciples once described to me one of the judge's brushes — it could write talismans out of thin air, which would make the written words come true.<br><br>Everyone claims that the Cloud Knights are the backbone of the Xianzhou's protection. In my opinion, that is just a front. The judges have far greater authority and power.<br><br>As our brethren move deeper, the judges will surely try to obstruct them. If, regardless of cost, we can capture or dispose of one of them then study their instruments, we may gain a deeper understanding of the Ten-Lords Commission.<br><br>...<br>...<br><br>The Shackling Prison<br><br>Committing any of the Ten Unpardonable Sins means becoming an enemy of the Xianzhou. It is believed that those who do so will be imprisoned in the bottomless dungeon called the Shackling Prison by the Ten-Lords Commission.<br><br>Some say the Shackling Prison is located at the bottom of the Xianzhou, in a vacuum where temperatures are near Absolute Zero. Some say the Ten-Lords Commission strings the dungeon delves together like beads and carries them under strict supervision by the judges. Others believe that the Shackling Prison is one of the six Xianzhou ships, dedicated to permanently suppressing prisoners.<br><br>As for the types of prisoners being held, the information begins to become mysteriously muddied. Speculations abound in tales of extraplanar beings fiercely repressed by the judges, indestructible long-life abominations, ancient aurumatons who can overturn the Xianzhou, or even Denizens of Abundance who once fought bloodily against the Xianzhou — it's almost an encyclopedia of conspiracies.<br><br>These tales are bizarre and none of them should be believed. The only common thread among all the tales is that the Shackling Prison houses extremely dangerous prisoners.<br><br>This makes one wonder if one could use the prisoners as weapons against the Ten-Lords Commission, if the entrance to the Shackling Prison could be found...<br><br>This is not just a whimsical idea, but a feasible one. For in the near future, I will fix my regrets and witness the return of celestial traces. Those great evils will also become ants under my control."

However, after transplanting and cultivating them, all the samples turned to powder. It is likely that they were constantly constrained by the waters of the ancient sea, causing them to lose their vitality upon separation from their original body. After all, both the samples and the ancient waters are mystical celestial traces and are elusive to comprehension.<br><br>However, I have already devised a plan to solve this mystery. I shall search the Elixir Research Terrace for ancient prescriptions and techniques, or seek the help of skilled individuals from beyond our borders.<br><br>To this end, I have met with the messenger. She has agreed to provide me with what I desire. Once the Seed is found, she will send someone to deliver it to the Xianzhou. I am not sure how she plans to accomplish this, but it was a condition of our agreement, so I shall wait and see.<br><br>As for the girl, she has learned quite well under the supervision of my predecessor, but she lacks sufficient experience and tends to be overly rebellious. The servant you sent must watch her every move. There is no need to worry, as she is not likely to break free from our control in the foreseeable future.<br><br>There is no need to send new samples after receiving this reply. Back then, we unintentionally created the miracle of Bloomborn Scion, but there is a limit to mere luck. Until I make further progress in my research, such a miracle is unlikely to occur again.<br><br>What we are trying to achieve is difficult. It could change the fate of countless people and even lead us to disaster. However, if we succeed, we will no longer be trapped in the predicament that has plagued us for thousands of years.<br><br>*signed only with a casually drawn talisman*"

Now that we're asked to work together and have each other's back, I'm really not used to it.<br><br>Naturally, I'm not used to having to look after someone who lost against me, but an order's an order, heh.<br><br>I jest. I really look forward to flying with you.<br><br>I don't know when we would receive a combat mission. I don't know what you think about our situation, but I think we both have considerable skills, and having to sit still and not fight enemies in the front lines, it's stifling.<br><br>Those Denizens of Abundance often raid the border and occasionally there are reports of them harming innocent planets. Every time I hear these news, I feel an overwhelming sense of anger... but now, things are different. After a while, we'll be able to show them what we're made of on our fighter jets.<br><br>Honestly though, I'm pretty satisfied with my life right now. After all... just between you and me, what I really wanted was never the righteous cause of ridding demonic activities. What attracts me is just the act of flying itself.<br><br>Look, flying out in the universe outside of the delves is entirely different from racing starskiffs that we're so used to... There is nothing to anchor us in space, there's not even a distinction between up and down. Our fighter jets would be hung in space by their lonesome selves like ships sailing in the middle of the ocean. By then, there is no one else you can rely on but your own skills and your jet.<br><br>Some may call this \"feeling lonely,\" but I prefer to call it freedom.<br><br>To me, to fly in space is already good enough. And if I can share this sweet freedom with you, then that's even better.<br><br>...<br><br>Caiyi, I don't know what to say to console you. You're always like this, no matter what terrible things happened to you, you would act strong, as if you don't need anyone to care for you, and you have terrible timing for jokes.<br><br>But we have been together for over a hundred years and I think we understand each other very well. You once said that if something is unpleasant for me, it would also be uncomfortable for you. I actually feel the same way, too.<br><br>Right now, my heart feels like it's being gouged out with a blunt, rusted knife. I can't imagine the amount of hurt and pain you're going through.<br><br>It's funny, I've never shown Guangyuan my good side. Every time you leave me alone to go on a mission with him, I feel uncomfortable. Especially when I see you two flirting and getting along as if you're inseparable, I can't help but want to glare at him with disdain.<br><br>But Guangyuan is a good person. No matter how rude I was to him, he was always kind to me. Thinking back on it now, I realize I'm just really bad at appreciating people.<br><br>Ah... he's really amazing. He managed to hold off several dozen enemy ships with only two people. This isn't something that can be done with just courage and resolve, it also requires exceptional skills and extraordinary talent.<br><br>I can imagine what it was like in his final moments, how his annoyingly handsome face must have shown such determination and focus. I guess that's why you fell in love with him in the first place.<br><br>I can imagine how proud he must've felt in that moment. He must've had no fear or hopelessness, only pride.<br><br>So you shouldn't be sad. You should be proud of him. We all should.<br><br>...<br><br>Caiyi, I've been having a lot of negative emotions recently that I cannot express to other fighters on the front line. Since you're recuperating in the rear, I'll just dump them on you.<br><br>Although it seems I'm a bit slow to say such words now, it was only recently that I realized that I am actually in the midst of such a cruel war.<br><br>Space combat is different from ground combat. Although both involve life and death in an instant, it is rare to see severed limbs and broken bodies in space, which led me to misjudge the brutality of this war. It wasn't until recently, as the situation on the front lines worsened, that the bloody reality gently but indisputably presented itself before me.<br><br>Someone might sit beside you for a meal today and be missing in action tomorrow. A new soldier earning praise and honor today might disappear the next. The captain I fought with today might not be found tomorrow. The ground troops that exchanged encouragement with me today might be eliminated the next.<br><br>At this point, I'm wary of building personal connections with anyone here. Perhaps that person would perish, or I might perish, or we might both perish in the day to come.<br><br>I thought I have experienced enough to feel numb, but bad news kept coming in waves every single day.<br><br>However, I don't regret this at all. Whenever the pain comes, the feeling that becoming a fighter pilot is the best choice I have made in my life will follow.<br><br>If I weren't a fighter pilot, I can only endure this pain in silence. But I am one. I can fly, I can fight, and I can attempt to destroy the source of my pain. Since I am a fighter pilot, I still have things that I can do, realities that I can change.<br><br>P.S.: Don't use the names Guangyuan came up with, they're terrible! Choosing a name is a big decision the child has to bear with for a lifetime! Use my suggestion instead, it's something I picked after diligently going through several collections worth of poetry.<br><br>...<br><br>Caiyi, I have a lot to tell you. So many things.<br><br>After your death, they wanted to honor me with a medal. Truthfully, I find that laughable.<br><br>Based on common logic, no one would award survivors medals to praise their fortuitous survival. But no, not the Sky-Faring Commission. They gave me a medal, called me a hero pilot, and the only reason for it is because of my luck to remain alive in that calamitous battle.<br><br>If you had been as lucky as me, we could've gotten the medals together. After the medal ceremony, we could've gone to Aurum Alley, have a few drinks, and laugh at the absurdity of it all.<br><br>It's a shame, luck is not on your side. We don't have that chance anymore.<br><br>I suddenly feel nostalgic. I remembered all the time we had steering our starskiffs across the Luofu sky. We were so carefree. There were no threats to our lives, and we didn't have to bear the calling of The Hunt. The entirety of the sky within the delve was ours — yours and mine. Above us was the delve's flashing dome ceiling, and below us were the bustling lights of ten thousand homes. Oh, and behind us, the Realm-Keeping Commission officers who just won't stop chasing us.<br><br>That was a time of insouciance, how I wish we could stay in that time forever.<br><br>..."

It's not like I can't bear to part with you, but I was worried to leave you with the others with your fiery temperament.<br><br>When you actually get to the battlefield, don't act recklessly like you do now, always charging in with hotheadedness. Before taking action, think more about the consequences. But it's okay, I don't want to talk about this anymore, or you'll accuse me of nagging like an old crone again. In any case, we need to work together, using our individual strengths to create our own legends in the vast sky.<br><br>I look forward to fighting in the vast skies with you, so much so that I'm finding it hard to fall asleep.<br><br>...<br><br>Yukong, don't cry. There is no need to be sad.<br><br>My husband was the one who died, but you're crying more than I am. After so many years of fighting, you're still so emotional. I'm envious.<br><br>Being a fighter pilot has always been a harrowing decision. Since we chose this path, we have to be mentally prepared. What's important is not whether we can survive by luck, but whether we can live up to the value of a pilot's life.<br><br>Guangyuan and his partner managed to keep an entire borisin fleet at bay. They were heroes. To me, that is enough.<br><br>I've heard it said that the greatest happiness in life is being able to choose how you die. From this perspective, to fight for the Xianzhou Alliance... no, for the people of the entire cosmos, to die on the battlefield after a lifetime of military service, Guangyuan is probably happy.<br><br>Of course, you better not have this kind of happiness, just live another two hundred years, behave, and then die of old age for me.<br><br>...<br><br>Yukong, it's been a long time. I'm still on my maternity leave in the rear. Everything is fine.<br><br>With the stalemate happening right now, you must be very busy. But when you have the chance, please take a moment to write an exchange diary entry for me, so that I can know you are still safe... and also, I have a mountain of things I want to talk to you about.<br><br>Firstly, an announcement. I've already decided on a name for our child.<br><br>Guangyuan has talked about this before. If it's a boy, name him Dragon, and if it's a girl, name her Phoenix. But this man's literary sense is as good as the monkeys in the Ever-Hunt Plains. No matter how much we should prioritize the wishes of my late husband, I cannot let his wants ruin my child's life.<br><br>So after much pondering, I've decided to go with your suggestion and name her Qingni — the colors of dawn.<br><br>\"The moonlit camp opens to a garden of archery, frosty banners brush the colors of dawn.\" How rare, you made the time and effort to look through poems and allegories. I thought you only cared about fighter jets.<br><br>Don't miss me too much. After taking a few months of break and settling Qingni down, I will be back in action ASAP. Qingni is still so young, and I need to leave her to fight a war... How should I say this, I'm such an irresponsible mother.<br><br>I am well aware. The situation on the front line doesn't look so good. The borisin keeps breaking our ranks. All the media outlets are trying to control the spread of panic and fear, but the Luofu is shrouded with a veil of uneasiness.<br><br>However, I believe the Xianzhou Alliance will win. I believe that warriors like you and me will repel those Denizens of Abundance to whence they come.<br><br>I look forward to fighting beside you once more.<br><br>...<br><br>Yukong, we will be heading toward a cruel battlefield tomorrow.<br><br>So tonight, there are some things I must entrust to you. (This may be somewhat ominous, but there's no help for it. Who made it so that we've never entrusted these things to each other before?)<br><br>If you lived and I didn't, please take care of Qingni like you would your own daughter. I know you will. I will entrust you with all my savings, please use that as living expenses for Qingni.<br><br>No matter what kind of person Qingni wants to become, please support her fully. Merchant, poet, street performer, anything except a fighter pilot.<br><br>Please allow me to make a vow with you: Do not let Qingni become a fighter pilot.<br><br>When we enlisted, you wrote in this diary: \"Our fighter jets would be hung in space by their lonesome selves like ships sailing in the middle of the ocean.\" \"...Some may call this 'feeling lonely,' but I prefer to call it freedom.\"<br><br>I really loved this segment, because I thought the same.<br><br>But that's enough.

                "Desc": "In recent times, the organization calling themselves Disciples of Sanctus Medicus has grown and caused trouble within the Xianzhou Alliance. Although the so-called \"master primus\" of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus has already been incarcerated, there are still many die-hard followers who stubbornly pursue revenge or revival.<br><br>In this context, the Ten-Lords Commission believes it is necessary to publish a manual that succinctly helps officials of various departments and spiritfarers to recognize the true nature of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and make it easier for everyone to help turn back those who have gone astray.<br><br>1. What is the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus?<br><br>In short, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus — who are currently acting indecorously in the Xianzhou Alliance — are a criminal organization that uses an ancient name and has been established for less than thirty years. Everyone should remember this and not be deceived by their wild claims of \"thousands of years of history.\"<br><br>After the Three Sufferings Era, the Xianzhou Alliance completely banned the belief in the Plagues Author and strictly prohibited the spread of the calamity of eternal life. Those who nostalgically longed for the Traces of Abundance of the Theophany Era founded a retrogressive religious group called the \"Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.\"<br><br>The followers of Disciples of Sanctus Medicus believe that they have inherited the knowledge and legacy of the Theophany Era, and with doubts about the goals of the alliance, they seek spiritual answers and continue to believe in the Abundance.<br><br>In the development following that, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus gradually crossed the line, following the Emanators of the Plagues Author and widening their influences by accepting unsavory characters into their ranks. Among them were not only individuals with political dissent and religious fanatics, but also traitors turned by Denizens of Abundance and overzealous outworlders with the intent of obtaining elixirs of immortality.<br><br>Before everything spiraled completely out of control, the Marshal made the decision to ban the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. After a long and arduous process of prohibition, the organization finally came to an end.<br><br>Thirty years ago, the third Abundance War broke out. The brutal war brought an indelible wound to the Xianzhou Alliance that could not be erased within a short time. Most people chose to carry this pain and continue moving forward. However, some with ulterior motives blamed the catastrophe orchestrated by the Plagues Author on the cruelty of the Alliance and the Reignbow Arbiter. The idea of overthrowing the Xianzhou Alliance arose. They gathered around a so-called \"master primus,\" twisted ancient texts, and claimed to be continuing the spirit of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, seeking to lead the people of Xianzhou back into the embrace of the Plagues Author.<br><br>The so-called \"master primus\" founded the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus not to revive the beliefs of the olden days, but to begin a new one under the guise of the ancient belief. If you read the classics that the disciples regard as their tenet, you will find that what they read and believe in is almost unrelated to the original Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.<br><br>For example, the <i>Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation</i> that their followers recite daily is not even a classic text written by the eradicated Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. According to the investigation by the Ten-Lords Commission, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus of the past valued texts such as the <i>Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence</i> that provide guidance for spiritual practice, while the <i>Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation</i> is a later forgery.<br><br><br>2. Is the confrontation between the Xianzhou Alliance and the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus a conflict of beliefs?<br><br>Yes, and no.<br><br>Yes, the Xianzhou Alliance is acting in accordance with the Reignbow Arbiter's edict, placing the destruction of the Plagues Author and their abominations as the prime priority. However, the conflict between the Xianzhou Alliance and the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus is not merely a conflict of beliefs.<br><br>Of the Ten Unpardonable Sins stipulated by the Ten-Lords Commission, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus has committed seven of them, including Involuntary Immortalization, Immortality Theft, Mara Ensnarement, Phratry Murder, Illicit Espionage, Sowing Discord, Incitement to Riot.<br><br>In the face of such a vicious criminal organization, even if there is no conflict of belief, even if the banner they hold high when committing crimes is the Reignbow Arbiter's, they must not be allowed to go unpunished.<br><br>Additionally, the Xianzhou Alliance is an open and inclusive civilization. Any outworlders — as long as they can abide by the Xianzhou laws, respect the Xianzhou customs and traditions, and not hurt the feelings of the Xianzhou people — regardless of their beliefs, is welcome through the doors of the Alliance.<br><br>In fact, among the short-life species residing within the Xianzhou Alliance, some came from civilizations where the Plagues Author is worshiped as a positive deity. The Alliance treats them fairly, protecting their lives and property, and upholding their rights to fair trade in the Alliance. Most of the outsiders who believe in the Plagues Author are also willing to reciprocate and show respect for the Alliance's beliefs and culture.<br><br>Despite having such sharp and irreconcilable conflicts, the Xianzhou Alliance can still set aside disputes with these outworlders and progress together. This is a manifestation of the open and inclusive spirit of the Xianzhou Alliance.<br><br>However, at the same time, the Ten-Lords Commission also hopes that some outworlders understand that the openness and inclusiveness that the Xianzhou Alliance displays does not mean it is weak and easy to bully. Regardless of the purpose, the Ten-Lords Commission will severely punish anyone who colludes with, funds, shelters, or harbors followers of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.<br><br>3. What do I do when I meet a Disciple of Sanctus Medicus?<br><br>The remnants of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus are all desperadoes, and even the Cloud Knights and judges may be endangered when confronting them. Ordinary people should avoid direct conflicts with them at all cost.<br><br>Therefore, we recommend that our colleagues in the commission follow the following advice:<br><br>First, you shall not believe a single word that these disciples uttered. Every single sentence they spout are plain lies.<br><br>Second, when necessary, you can deceive them and pretend to have the intention to join them. When they let their guard down, you can seize the opportunity to escape or report them to the authorities.<br><br>Third, if a situation arises where a direct confrontation is unavoidable, one should gather the courage to fight back. Statistics from the Realm-Keeping Commission show that in such life-or-death situations, those who actively resist have a greater chance of survival.<br><br>Fourth, immediately contact the nearby Realm-Keeping Commission office or the Cloud Knights and spiritfarers stationed in the area after escaping. Do not go home directly, as this may attract unnecessary trouble."

Liu Hua was a Vidyadhara from the Xianzhou Fanghu. He was a Pearlkeeper that supported the Fanghu high elder for the first three hundred years of his life, and became the head healer that closely served the Fanghu high elder for the last four hundred.<br><br>Through his long years of clinical practice and research, Liu Hua had acutely realized the Xianzhou medical science's problem at that time. The Xianzhou's tradition of preserving the past meant significant amounts of medical practice relied on experience instead of science. For the Xianzhou natives of the time, their millennia of medical experience was far more reliable than scientific theories written on paper.<br><br>Liu Hua therefore authored this <i>Liu Hua's Medical Compendium</i> in the hopes of re-organizing and better explaining the principles of Xianzhou medical science using more scientific methods of inquiry.<br><br>The book did not gain much attention at the time of its publication. It was not until ninety-three years after Liu Hua's hatching rebirth that a group of young Alchemy Commission members on the Luofu formed an innovative organization in the Cold Springs delve, later named \"Cold Springs Sect\" by posterity. The Cold Springs Sect re-discovered how <i>Liu Hua's Medical Compendium</i> had a vision before its time and offered critical value to the field of medicine, and regarded the book the standard for medicine.<br><br>Later, the Cold Springs Sect's innovative thoughts were gradually acknowledged by the various groups in the Alliance, and <i>Liu Hua's Medical Compendium</i> also finally gained the importance it deserves.<br><br><br><i>Key Tenets of Long-Life</i><br><br>As the earliest contact point of the Ambrosial Arbor, the healers of the Luofu's Alchemy Commission have a deeper understanding of the core principles, biology, anatomy, and the process of conversion of long-life species than healers on the other Xianzhou ships do.<br><br>Everyone knows the author of <i>Key Tenets of Long-Life</i> is the famous healer Changsang from the Theophany Era. Some medical historians share the belief that this book was based on Changsang's writings, and only emerged in its current form after repeated modifications and edits by those who came later. For example, many records about the civilizations of long-life species were only discovered after the Theophany Era.<br><br><i>Key Tenets of Long-Life</i> lists the physiological characteristics of twenty-six long-life species, all of which are further supported by anatomical and genetic evidence. In particular, the study of the Xianzhou natives' physiology has a profound impact on the establishment of the relevant regulations in the Ten-Lords Commission.<br><br>...<br>..."

During the period before the Xianzhou set sail, alchemy was already divided into the medical and artifex branches, and the art was considered the most important cultural inheritance retained from the Primeval Imperium. In the era of the Ambrosial Arbor, medical alchemy progressed even further by leaps and bounds, illustrating the wonders of life across all its changes.<br><br>Following the Flaming Catastrophe War, many alchemical prescriptions in the <i>Achievements in Alchemy</i> were destroyed because of the Ambrosial Arbor and could never be restored. Nevertheless, a vast number of remedies recorded in the book can still be applied. For example, the revitalization pellet that enhances the self-healing capabilities of long-life species and the gallantry infusion that strengthens muscles and increases muscle power are military prescriptions still used even to this day.<br><br><br><i>Compendium of Remedies</i><br><br>This book is compiled by Dan Shu, the chief alchemist of the Luofu Alchemy Commission. Dan Shu's team extensively researched almost all the materia medica from the Theophany Era to the present, carefully selecting and summarizing a total of 39,500 medicinal prescriptions. About 3,726 of them were invented by Dan Shu and her team through medical practice.<br><br>The <i>Compendium of Remedies</i> is widely recognized as the pinnacle of pharmacological achievements in Xianzhou's 8,000-year history. The book categorizes all the prescriptions into 28 sections based on the ailments they treat. Among them, the volumes of the Vasculature Section, the Orthopedic Section, and the Transfiguration Section are the most complete and detailed. The Gourd-Born Section and the Hatching-Born Section encompass the medical techniques of foxians and Vidyadhara. The Mara Section is the most impressive, as it compiles the latest research findings on the study of mara-struck conditions over the past few centuries. After this book was published, it immediately became a must-have guidebook for every alchemist of the Alchemy Commission. It's also designated as the official textbook for all related disciplines in the academy.<br><br>Due to various reasons, the Alchemy Commission has irrevocably gone downhill.

Therefore, the \"Exotic Knowledge\" in <i>The Comprehensive Handbook of Exotic Knowledge</i> specifically refers to \"medical science from outworlders.\" This book is also the first work in the history of the Alliance that systematically presented the medical science of foreign civilizations.<br><br><i>The Comprehensive Handbook of Exotic Knowledge</i> occupies an important place in the history of the Xianzhou civilization's contact with the outside world. It could even be said that the book had profoundly influenced the direction of the Xianzhou civilization's development, shaping the Alliance into what it is today.<br><br>The author of this book is unknown. It is thought to be a collective work from the Alchemy Commission staff of the Xianzhou Yuque and Yaoqing. According to <i>The Chronicles of the Yuque</i>, the editing of this book was a part of the \"Exotic Knowledge Revival Movement\" spearheaded by Dieyu, the Cauldron Master of Yuque's Alchemy Commission at the time. It is commonly thought that Dieyu also directly led the editing of <i>The Comprehensive Handbook of Exotic Knowledge</i>.<br><br>When published, <i>The Comprehensive Handbook of Exotic Knowledge</i> was split into three volumes according to civilization clusters, with four chapters in each volume. The first volume was \"The IPC Volume,\" the second was \"The Guild Volume,\" and the third was \"The Abomination Volume.\" The third volume encountered significant push back toward publication. Even though Dieyu overcame public scrutiny, the third volume was only made available seventy years after the first two had been published.<br><br>Time proved that \"The Abomination Volume\" provided a very positive contribution to the development of Xianzhou's medical sciences. After all, both the IPC and the Guild are civilizations dominated by short-life species, and the residents within their domains have drastically different anatomies and physiology to long-life species. Though the Alliance could learn from their scientific thought processes and medical technologies, there was only so much to gain from them.<br><br>Meanwhile, the topic of investigation for \"The Abomination Volume\" are the Denizens of Abundance, long-life species just like the Xianzhou residents. Wingweavers and borisin have always had their own unique medical science systems, but the Xianzhou natives habitually looked down upon these abominations' technical achievements in the millennia prior. Now, we are well aware of the kind of danger that lurks in our arrogance and spite toward enemies. However, for the Xianzhou natives of the time, publishing a work such as \"The Abomination Volume\" that humbly learned from our enemies was practically tantamount to treason.<br><br>Thankfully, Dieyu was able to withstand pressure and could rid the entire Alliance of the shackles of arrogance and spite, thus obtaining more useful knowledge.<br><br><br><i>Grand Encyclopedia of Xianzhou — Chapter on Medical Sciences</i><br><br>This book was authored by Izumitamagawa bint Amatullah from the IPC, who was an expert on the study of Xianzhou, a natural scientist, and a writer.<br><br>In the year 7032, 23-year-old Izumitamagawa arrived at the Xianzhou Zhuming as a trade specialist, and resided there as a visitor for the rest of her life. She realized that the cosmos' knowledge of the Xianzhou Alliance at the time was mostly based on incomplete stories or unfounded rumors. Therefore, she resolved to author an epic work that would comprehensively present the Xianzhou civilization to foreigners. That was how, forty years later, the <i>Grand Encyclopedia of Xianzhou</i> was born.<br><br>The Chapter on Medical Sciences features prominently in this epic work, taking up almost one-third of the pages. In the Chapter on Medical Sciences, Izumitamagawa used the IPC's medical system to classify all the medical and pharmacological works that could be found in the entire Xianzhou Alliance, as well as recounting their histories and explaining their principles.<br><br>While the Chapter on Medical Sciences is only an amateur piece of work when compared against professional pharmacopoeias and medical textbooks, this publication still managed to achieve Izumitamagawa's original goal of letting every traveler understand Xianzhou's medical sciences.<br><br>...<br>..."

Apart from certain mad followers of theodicy, there were also some who tried to establish a medical system rooted in the worship of Yaoshi.<br><br>The most wide-spread and influential among these books is <i>Yaoshi's Manual of Viscerals</i>. This book is the first to systematically establish the \"Yaoshi medical sciences\" while tightly connecting this science to the worship of the Plagues Author. With this negative impact, the book became the beginning of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.<br><br>This book originally had seventy-five volumes split into medical sciences, pharmacology, magic, and artisanship. Now, most of these volumes have been lost. The version currently available is a four-volume version re-edited from the remnants of the book by archivists.<br><br>These residual chapters were mainly taken from books, manuscripts, and private correspondences of the time that rebuked the religion of Sanctus Medicus, and some of them could be inaccurate or plain untrue.<br><br><br><i>Theories on Returning From the Underworld</i><br><br>An infamous heretical medical text. Its author is very likely an alchemist or healer who continued to worship the Abundance in secret after the establishment of the Xianzhou Alliance.<br><br><i>Theories on Returning From the Underworld</i> records sixteen different outrageous ways to \"resurrect\" short-life species after their lifespans have expired. For example, the Hive-Soul Technique sacrifices the body of the deceased to the immortal soul snatch bees, letting them parasitize the body and turn it into a hive, then using the species' hivemind consciousness to achieve rebirth. Alternatively, the Blood Hatching Curse transplants the scales and flesh of the half-human half-snake Cobrakinds into the person to deliberately infect them with the blood fever of the hatching snakes, thus transforming them into long-life species.<br><br>All these forbidden arts, without exception, require exceptional mastery in methods such as surgical operations and gene therapy. Some of these are closely linked to the IPC and the Intelligentsia Guild, leading the majority of medical historians to conjecture that this book was completed with foreign help.<br><br><br><i>Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence</i><br><br>Scripture composed by anonymous alchemists in the branch of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus known as the Inner Secrets Sect.<br><br>All extant copies of this book are replicas of the original. Its foreword records the process through which this book re-emerged into the light of day. In approximately Year 6610 of the Star Calendar, the Luofu Alchemy Commission's Elixir Research Terrace was conducting an inventory of its books when they discovered this book in their collection by pure accident. The Alchemy Commission at the time sank into intense debate regarding whether this book should be destroyed. In the end, Baize, the Cauldron Master of the Alchemy Commission, opted for middle ground: The original copy would be destroyed, but the content will be reproduced and sealed away. Only the Cauldron Master of the Alchemy Commission, the chief healer, the chief alchemist, the lead medical assistant, and any officials ranked higher than these positions may consult this book as a historical reference.<br><br>The believers of the Inner Secrets Sect in the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus are convinced that the Xianzhou natives' bodies possess circulatory vessels in the branching form of the Ambrosial Arbor after receiving the blessings of the Arbor and becoming long-life species. These circuits lead toward an organ known as the Core Esse, which is key to the Xianzhou natives' second evolution (alternatively known as the ascension).<br><br>Based on the theoretical foundations of <i>Yaoshi's Manual of Viscerals</i>, the <i>Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence</i> systematically explained the circulatory structure of the Xianzhou natives. It also proposed that the body should be considered as soil, the breath considered rain, and combined they nurture the Core Esse (a seed) to spread the circulatory system (as branches), finally achieving an \"inner Ambrosial Arbor\" that thrives and grows as an \"inner secret.\" The Yellow Pneuma mentioned in the book's title is an essence that drives the vitals in the theories of the Inner Secrets Sect, and opposes the Black Prana that symbolizes death and decay. The author believes that the purpose of life is to maintain the presence of Yellow Pneuma and let life continue to evolve.<br><br>The views of the Inner Secrets Sect have long been considered superstition. However, it is important to mention that some excerpts of its medical theories have been included in later scientific texts.<br><br><br><i>Divine Scripture of the Secrets and Miracles of Shuhu's Manifestations</i><br><br>One of the scriptures left by the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Its author is Yueyan, the foxian Helm Master of the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission. He was a knowledgeable pilot, and also helped the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus to thrive as its first master primus.<br><br>According to records in the <i>Ten-Lords Commission's Book of Imprisonment</i>, Yueyan witnessed how the Ruin Author's Legion destroyed Muldrasil, the home world of the wingweavers, after the first Denizens of Abundance Wars. Due to Xianzhou's creed of eradicating abominations, the Alliance stood by and observed the entire process. The overwhelming death and destruction shook Yueyan's belief to the core, and he proclaimed that he must re-think about the long-life species' duty and purpose in life.<br><br>In the end, Yueyan left his position and drove a starskiff to roam the stellar seas in search of an answer. On the ancient planet of Rahu, he found an Emanator of the Plagues Author — a living entity called Shuhu. Yueyan witnessed how Shuhu granted life back to Rahu, which had long ago become a dead planet, and caused the planet to throb like an embryo in the mother's womb. He followed Shuhu and recorded their healing miracles and various teachings, ultimately composing this scripture.<br><br>...<br>..."

Besides, I also genuinely believe you are able to read this.<br><br>Your eyes have always been able to see everything you want to see. Someone like me should not have been born, yet now I live a wealthy life and have friends such as Yufei by my side. I thank your blessings every second of every day.<br><br>Therefore, I hope everything I've done recently would not offend your peerless authority... I bear no dissatisfaction with the world of Xianzhou that you guard and protect. I simply wish to see the real world in real colors.<br><br>When I was a child in the lyceum and my peers bullied me for my lack of sight, I had always firmly believed my condition to be a trial sent by the Reignbow Arbiter to test me. I maintained that belief in my later years when I entered the academy and had to spend more effort than others to keep up with my studies.<br><br>As if to reward me for my tenacity, you sent Yufei to be my friend. When we were seven years old, she chased away the malevolent classmates bullying me, and she has been my best friend ever since.<br><br>Yufei protected me from the bullies and helped me to keep up with my studies. During the school holidays, she would take me to visit glamorous scenes in the various ecological delves and describe their beauty to me with great vividness. Her voice is very pleasant to listen to, like the touch of cold streams brushing past my fingertips.<br><br>In theory, I shouldn't be dissatisfied with life at all.<br><br>However... humans are visual creatures, and we perceive the world via lights and colors. I simply do not know what Yufei means when she says \"the dusk painted the sky red at the end of the forest like a flame.\" In fact, I don't even know what Yufei looks like. I can touch, I can imagine, and yet I still cannot construct a complete picture.<br><br>Therefore, with Yufei's support, I decided to find a way to restore sight to myself.<br><br>By the blessing of the Reignbow, I have become the best alchemist in the Alchemy Commission, and Yufei is its best healer. Perhaps we can indeed find a way to free the Incomplete Ones from our eternal torment.<br><br>...<br><br>Yufei and I had tried many strategies recently, but none of them worked.<br><br>Firstly, we tried to non-invasively create prosthetic eyes. In fact, this is how my ingenium arm works, which can function as well as a real arm.<br><br>Theoretically, these non-intrusive methods can help Incomplete Ones with visual impairments. However, for those with visual neuron developmental issues such as I, non-intrusive methods can do little to help.<br><br>Secondly, we tried to create vision using the principles behind Butterfly Immersia. At its core, Butterfly Immersia uses foxian pheromones to create controllable illusions. We wondered whether it can therefore bypass the eye as a visual signal receptor, and directly send images to the brain.<br><br>The outcomes indicated this to be a viable strategy. However, these signals failed to form meaningful images in my brain. It did allow me to \"see\" colors and shapes for the first time, but I genuinely cannot tell what is \"red\" and what is \"a circle.\"<br><br>We guess this is due to how Butterfly Immersias rely on the experiencer's senses to recreate images. Therefore, when faced with sensory stimuli that I have never experienced before, even the foxians' pheromones were helpless.<br><br>How odd. It showed me so many colors, but I don't really miss that feeling.<br><br>Thirdly, we tried to trigger sensory compensation using other senses. This was Yufei's idea, which was an extension of the non-invasive prosthetic eyes concept — By converting visual signals into auditory, tactile, gustatory, or olfactory signals, these other sensory organs could create a whole new concept of \"sight.\"<br><br>We created a prototype gadget, but our biggest challenge was its size. All the external sensors added together are heavier than the weight of three humans combined. It was a pain to even walk while carrying them, let alone testing them.<br><br>Nevertheless, we still conducted many tests. Our results indicate this tool is much better suited for short-life species. Their brains have greater plasticity, through which sensory compensation can trigger synesthesia, where one sensory organ activates a different sensory organ. If they use this tool for long periods of time, they would be able to realistically \"taste,\" \"hear,\" or \"smell\" colors, shapes, and visual distances.<br><br>However, for long-life species with low neuroplasticity (such as I), these sensory organs cannot come together to create a brand-new sense. Admittedly, I now know the testing block is blue whenever I taste chili peppers; and if I smell a frosty scent after that, then I know the block is a cone in shape. But I still have not \"seen\" them, let alone know what \"blue\" means...<br><br>Though short-life species will gain more from this tool, most of their bodily issues can be solved by invasive prosthetics and would have no need for something as complicated as this.<br><br>These experiments cost huge amounts of time and effort for Yufei and me, yet we have produced almost no viable results. I can't even be sure whether these experiments can help other researchers in the future.<br><br>I feel dejected and powerless, and I feel like I let Yufei down.<br><br>...<br><br>I got in touch with Professor Egan from the Intelligentsia Guild. He presented a rather outlandish solution, something he called \"Eliminative Materialism Therapy.\"<br><br>Eliminative Materialism is an ancient philosophical idea that states all human emotions arise from internal steroids and electrical signals. Professor Egan believes that if we cannot eliminate the root of the Incomplete Ones' suffering, then we will eliminate the suffering itself.<br><br>As long as we use a pump to periodically inject specific medications into the body, we can make the person not care about their physical issues. I will have no desire to see the world, and not feel sad about my condition at all.<br><br>It sounds very bizarre, but it seems to be a viable path.<br><br>Unfortunately, the experimental results indicate this does not work for long-life species, either.<br><br>The hormones within long-life species are strictly regulated, and any external force that influences this system would cause an overwhelming retaliation.<br><br>I experienced uncaring freedom for about one dual-hour before almost dying from a cytokine storm.<br><br>...<br><br>I've conducted lots of experiments. There has been no progress whatsoever. I'm feeling really defeated.<br><br>But I want to see what Yufei looks like, even if for just once. So I asked behind Yufei's back (she would never agree to something as ludicrous) for Professor Egan to transplant a pair of eyes for me.<br><br>I saw myself and Yufei for the first time. Her short black hair shimmered with light like soft silk, and her pale skin was beautiful like the best ceramics from the Zhuming. Her ebony eyes were bloodshot with sadness and fatigue, and she kept shedding tears.<br><br>She looked at my new eyes and said: \"Dan Shu, do you know what this means to you?\"<br><br>I know. Of course I know. These eyes will gradually be rejected, bringing me unimaginable pain in the process. Historically, people have even become stricken with mara due to such agony.<br><br>Then, I would return to the darkness and lose everything I have momentarily gained.<br><br>I said to Yufei: \"Let's go see those views together, the ones you told me about.\"<br><br>Ten days later, we stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing at the artificial sun gradually disappearing on the other side of the delve's false sky. The rejection reaction was getting stronger and stronger, but as long as she was beside me, it didn't seem so bad.<br><br>The dusk painted the sky red at the end of the forest like a flame.<br><br>That night, as I screamed in a puddle of my own blood, I once again returned to the darkness."

Countless spots of light encircled her, like stars breathing and dancing in the cosmos. If you look closer, you may find that the light spots are sealed in a translucent jar, like shrines immured on walls.<br><br>\"These Core Esse...\" The wolf-head Master uttered, \"So they are what you obtained from the divine relic.\"<br><br>\"The Master of Immortality only granted us power, but cultivated the seed of the sacred tree in you. How unfair...\"<br><br>\"I put thirty thousand people to death and had the anatomist dissect their live Core Esse for these Esse Shrine. I've made further studies of them.\"<br><br>\"My studies have proven me right. The heart is for the sake of sustaining life, and Core Esse is to absorb power from the root. This organ is much more important than the heart. It can be regarded as the 'engine' of the body.\"<br><br>\"Now I am using them to propel this fleet, using their organs to destroy their own alliance!\"<br><br>The wolf-head man lifted off the gorgeous mantle that covered his chest, and revealed a jellyfish-like translucent armor coating his bulging muscles. He inhaled deeply, as if he could consume all the air within this narrow space. In seconds, his hunched body expanded muscle by muscle, and turned into a huge iron tower of flesh. The cracking bones and warping flesh generated a sharp and painful noise during the deformation, and quickly healed.<br><br>The wolf-head man has long been used to these pains. As he breathed, a weak glimmer of light overflowed from his mouth, nose, eyes, and ears. His Core Esse started to shine brightly.<br><br>\"This armor fits well my blood and flesh. It is like it were an organ attached to my body. However, its prowess is yet to be tested.\"<br><br>\"My opponents have all turned into balls of flesh with just one blow. Maybe the High-Cloud Quintet can help me know its true limit!\"<br><br>The lady's eyes were as dark and cold as ice, as if the things happening in front of her were dull and uninteresting.<br><br>Thirty thousand soldiers, thirty thousand Core Esse that are kindles of life... She tried not to get distracted by the cruelty of the miracle before her eyes.<br><br>The subtle balance between the two sides is hard to maintain. One would take their advantage precisely when they get the chance. The wolf-head man soared forward as a mass of gray storm.<br><br>In the next heartbeat, the lady disappeared. The spot she stood before was only left with a sharp footprint. With a flicker of a sword flash, comes a loud sonic boom...<br><br>..."

On the contrary, all THEY offer is an infinite number of questions. Many people spend their whole lives walking through a fog of ignorance, eager for knowledge but unable to find a proper approach. THEY are hindered by things such as \"precedents\" and \"knowledge.\" Visiting Nous is enough to open the eyes of even the most ignorant people, to see the problem. But the answer may only be found by oneself.<br><br>The dauntless scholars of the Divination Commission can follow the example of great scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild by stepping on \"the road to opening one's eyes.\" If fate is predestined, the counsel of Nous must be sought.<br><br><br><b>Cloudstrider</b><br><br>Lord of the Path of Trailblaze. Known by the Nameless as Akivili, god of roaming.<br><br>Only several unverifiable legends about the Cloudstrider remain. For the Xianzhou people, the word \"legend\" connotes images of an unfathomably ancient time. Since the first epoch of the Amber Era, Akivili has sped through the wild worlds of the cosmos. It's precisely because of the Nameless' and THEIR existence that those isolated worlds scattered throughout the dark cosmos are able to know each other.<br><br>The Cloudstrider's most important miracles have been creating the \"chromatic echelon\" and \"star rail.\" Legend has it that the chromatic echelon is a key component of laying the star rail network, and the star rail itself can connect distant galaxies by means of a mysterious mechanism. Be it the Interastral Peace Corporation or the Xianzhou, the safe routes we all rely upon today all follow remnants of these star tracks. If Akivili had never fallen, it's hard to imagine how effortless contact between the planets would be like today.<br><br>Based on the Xianzhou Yuque's latest intel, the Cloudstrider's chromatic echelon has reappeared after thousands of years. Abominations run rampant, and the Legion ravages the people... In these troubled times, what can the Nameless bring to the cosmos? I can scarcely imagine.<br><br><br><b>Joyseeker</b><br><br>Lord of the Path of Elation. Known by the Masked Fools and Mourning Actors as Aha, god of tricksters.<br><br>If we lay out a spectrum from \"Mortal\" to \"Aeon\" based on an Aeon's modus operandi, then Aha is an Aeon who is closer to the mortal end of things. THEY play with the love, hate, joy, and sorrow of intelligent creatures to subvert and shift fate — as THEIR followers put it, THEY enjoy this and even manifest in human form sometimes to catalyze the change.<br><br>It would be wrong to assume that the Joyseeker is a jester among the Aeons. Yes, THEY can't really perform earth-shattering miracles like the Reignbow Arbiter or the Firmamend Arbiter. However, by using THEIR invisible hand, THEY can imperceptibly influence the movements of all living things. This demonstrates an extraordinary and delicate manipulation of reality.<br><br>For example, during Emperor Rubert's campaign, Aha's believers kicked off another riot after the Philosopher Union was reduced to the domain of inorganic life, infecting the conqueror's computer systems with another troll virus called the \"Philosopher's Poison\" and overthrowing the local robot army.<br><br>Similar miracles abound, and tiny ripples eventually become a tsunami that can shake the whole world — this is Aha's style.<br><br><br><b>Wondergazer</b><br><br>Lord of the Path of Beauty. Known as Idrila, god of beauty by the Knights of Beauty and the Mirror Holders. Known on some worlds as Anne Duray.<br><br>So far, the Knights of Beauty have been disbanded, leaving the Mirror Holders to wander the stars, searching for THEIR holy relics. All of this serves as proof that THEY have fallen. But my documents exchanged with the Intelligentsia Guild mention: If the relics of the Wondergazer can be found intact, THEIR beautiful countenance will be able to reappear.<br><br>According to ancient myth, Idrila once attributed the beauty of all the segmenta to THEMSELF, showing heroes, villains, and mortals the meaning and aesthetics contained within the cosmic landscape, and driving them to complete astonishing (but often devastating) achievements for Idrila's own pleasure. This myth may reveal the true meaning behind the Path of Beauty: The integration of consciousness, insight, and values.<br><br>...<br>..."

The Denizens of Abundance and the Xianzhou Alliance know them as Yaoshi, the god of life.<br><br>In short, you diviners must have read about the myth of THEM manifesting aboard the Luofu to leave behind the Ambrosial Arbor. Perhaps you've heard about that while studying in the lyceum, serving in the Cloud Knights, or reading novels. There is no need for this book to devote pages to it.<br><br><b>It is worth reiterating to everyone once more that any action involving predicting the Plagues Author's fate are viewed as an unforgivable felony.</b><br><br>I know that diviners suffer from hubris during their first hundred years of practice, sinking into a form of madness gained from possessing extraordinary knowledge. They would believe they can now control destiny, that they literally have the power to decipher the entire world. They would be deluded to the point of ignoring the ban on running divinations on Aeons, and try learning the secrets of Auspice Sliver. A blind eye can be turned if a diviner tries to predict the fate of other Aeons. However, the Ten-Lords Commission has issued a ban on predicting Yaoshi's fate, listing it as a crime equal to the Ten Unpardonable Sins and promising strict punishment — that is, if you are even still alive after your transgression.<br><br>The Plagues Author is the reason the Xianzhou natives became a long-life species. There is therefore some sort of undefinable and remote connection between us and Yaoshi. This kind of connection cannot yet be explained by physics, and may be one of the causes of mara. Moreover, anyone trying to peer at Yaoshi by means of divination will suffer a similar backlash. Every instance of such actions so far has led to tragic results. These records are filed away under \"Violations\" at the Divination Commission's repository. Diviners, please study them carefully.<br><br><br><b>Ruin Author</b><br><br>Ruler of the Path of Destruction. Known as Nanook, god of destruction, by the Antimatter Legion and Annihilation Gang.<br><br>Despite being the most recently ascended Aeon, Nanook and THEIR minions may already be considered the greatest menace in all the cosmos. In contrast to how the healing forces of the Plagues Author brought about mutation and destructive results, the Ruin Author causes chaos in a far more direct way. THEY and THEIR Emanators lead the Antimatter Legion on their march to invade all civilized worlds, turning these planets to ashes.<br><br>Despite following the Reignbow Arbiter's edict to hunt down Abundance and out-of-control abominations, the Alliance has also fought tens of thousands of skirmishes against the Legion. Our scout's reports begin to often lack news from planets that have established civil relations with the Xianzhou. All of this is drastically worrying. Perhaps, in the near future, the abominations won't be the only nemesis that Xianzhou has to face.<br><br><br><b>Swarm Author</b><br><br>Ruler of the Path of Propagation. Known by the IPC and other victimized planets as Tayzzyronth, god of proliferation. Known on some worlds as the Imperator Insectorum.<br><br>Despite the Imperator Insectorum's early demise, THEY've cast a shadow of terror on the universe no less than that of Emperor Rubert's. The Alchemy Commission has collected from many planets unique bio-contaminant samples, which are the swarm's evolved genes known as \"propagation vector.\" The Armed Archaeologists from the Intelligentsia Guild have provided even more evidence that stars seeded by the Swarm Author have irreparably become literal hellscapes, and their only end lies in obliteration by star destroyer arsenals to prevent future danger.<br><br>According to the scholar, such horrors have not completely disappeared. The Imperator Insectorum's descendants remain, and THEY could return at any moment. This scholar once showed me his collection — A dull yellow piece of amber with moving flecks and a buzzing tremor. I was absolutely gob-smacked to hear him say that it is part of the \"Imperator Insectorum's Prison Cell.\" The omniscia implanted in my forehead could not see the future of this item, which only serves to corroborate the scholar's claims. All I can do is pray in silence to the Reignbow that such a day will not come soon.<br><br>...<br>..."

I fantasized about what it would be like in the Chancery if I were absent for the whole day.<br><br>I know very well that nothing at all will happen. The Xianzhou will keep sailing on through space no matter who leaves, just as Reignbow's arrow will always shoot toward its intended target.<br><br>I've been growing more and more impatient these days with trivial junk at work. Every time a new task comes in, I'll curse it alongside my colleagues both up and downstream who've been involved in it, then I'll grit my teeth and get on with the task. It's impossible to delegate to a subordinate, because young people are so carefree and only do what they want. They dream of taking a work trip out to distant planets, but do not care about the bits and pieces of work going on around them.<br><br>The work we do at the Realm-Keeping Commission is meaningless. In my 122 years there, they keep repeating things over and over again in different ways, and they'll keep on repeating until the end of time.<br><br>I don't want to work.

These bodies of ours may not grow old, but our minds have long been hollowed out by all those past memories.<br><br>I once dreamed that I was back on the battlefield. Wielding crossbows with my Cloud Knight brethren, this giant sword followed around behind us, searching out enemies. We went back to Dikong; went back to the Giant's Arm system; went back to the islands of Thalassa; fought all kinds of Abominations of Abundance along the way.<br><br>I dreamed that I was surrounded by inhuman beasts. The sword swirled around beside me, slicing and dicing before they shatter into pieces. Fluid from the enemy corpses smeared me on the face. I didn't expect it to be not cold; I didn't expect it to be so red.<br><br>The dreamscape went completely red, and huge monsters with chitinous silicone shells roared loudly, crushing all the approaching squads into a pulp. The Abominations rolled up their insect-like wings, and a chilly, painful gust blasted them straight in the face.<br><br>I wanted to see what my brethren looked like again. But nobody was around me. Looking down, I saw acquiescent faces on the ground, expressions frozen as screams of wishes left unfulfilled. Every eyeball was like a scratched marble as it fell to the dust, firmly gripping the skies.<br><br>Long-life species... This joke made me laugh out loud and woke me up.<br><br>My right arm is burning right where it's torn off, as though I'd just been plucked from a monster's maw.

More than once, actually.<br><br>The first time was back when I started as an orderly at the Realm-Keeping Commission. I saw a group of kids walking the streets of Drifters Sanctum with lanterns in hand. It was nighttime, and even the moon and starlight were removed from the delve's artificial sky. Everyone was locked safely away in their homes with not another soul about. Only those children walked in silence with lamps floating beside them, as though they were spawned straight out of the darkness itself. I knew the man walking behind them. He was my father.<br><br>When Dad turned 646 years old, he suddenly started blurting out nonsense. He'd ask why I knocked over the rice bowl on the table, why I burnt his clothes, and why I kicked his jade abacus around like a soccer ball... Those were probably my unruly conduct back when I was a teenager. I couldn't remember anything about them myself. Over the next few days, he went off food and drink and stopped responding to people — just sitting there like a living corpse, like a cobweb that manifested in an abandoned corner of the house. Filled with dust. Devoid of life.<br><br>I realized he was displaying signs of the five decays and was on the verge of being stricken with mara. According to the rules, I invited an Alchemy Commission healer to do an outpatient run, still wanting to see if he had any possibility of recovery. The healer prescribed a few different medications, then looked me straight in the eye and warned me to be prepared.<br><br>\"Prepared for what?\" I asked the healer. The healer replied with a practiced expression, \"prepare for your father to be taken away.\"<br><br>It was then I knew that Dad's time had come. I knew that everyone in Xianzhou has to face such a day sooner or later, but now that it was happening to Dad... everything just seemed so sudden.<br><br>I picked up the prescription from the table and read it again and again, like a master poring over a disciple's homework. The healer suddenly reached over and grabbed a corner of the prescription, as if to take it back. I understood her tacit intent: There is no medicinal cure for being mara-struck. But I remembered gripping that prescription tightly, muttering again and again: \"Just try this medicine one more time. One more time. Just one more time.\" She pulled back her hand in the face of my stubbornness, and busied herself with preparing the remedy.<br><br>As expected, Dad never said another word to me after that, until he walked up to me with those children. Perhaps it was an illusion, but he seemed younger. It is ridiculous to suggest that a Xianzhou native could grow younger. Our appearance doesn't change once we reach adulthood — but our demeanor certainly can. Dad was walking briskly with a look of liberation and freedom about him. That dusty, lifeless look on his face was gone.<br><br>I opened my mouth to call for Dad, but the words got stuck in my throat. Before I could speak, he spoke softly and clearly. \"Take care of yourself.\" It felt like he had recovered, that he returned from the brink of being mara-struck... But I knew it was just my wishful thinking. Those two children blew out their lamps, and in the blink of an eye, all I could see was darkness — as though Dad and those children had never existed.<br><br>I even forgot about my night shift, and just stood there alone in the darkness. A moment later, I suddenly remembered that prescription the healer had left me. I'd been keeping it in my breast pocket, but fishing around in there, I realized that it wasn't there anymore."

Their planet of origin remains unknown. However, judging by genetic screen results, the borisin share a common ancestor with the foxians — yet the two have diverged onto very different paths.<br><br>Foxian epics tell how the races were divinely inspired by the Master of Immortality from beyond the stars. Drinking from the Redspring, they were granted immortality. But later historical developments saw the borisin consider the foxians as slaves or cannon fodder, fueling their desire to conquer the stars.<br><br>According to verifiable Alliance records, there have been three large-scale wars between the Xianzhou and the borisin, with heavy losses on both sides. Therefore, the Cloud Knights must remain vigilant about the borisin's movements.<br><br><b>Physiology</b><br><br>The borisin have a distinct canine anatomical structure: Broad, slender skeletons; powerful jaws and neck muscles; well-developed fangs; pointed ears atop the skull; and sharp claws on hand and foot.<br><br>Within the broad classification of long-life species, the borisin can be said to have the greatest healing ability.<br><br>Alongside this hyper-healing is their ability to shapeshift (known as \"Moon Rage\" by the borisin). This ability has also been observed very rarely in some foxians (apart from the foxians of the Yaoqing). Shapeshifting is accompanied by intense hyperplasia of the bone and muscle structure, such as a protruded snout and jawline, and the twisting in of the foot structure. This damaging deformation process is eventually completely restored by the borisin's rapid healing ability.<br><br>During battle, the borisin emit a pheromone known as Lupitoxin, which stimulates fear in the amygdala. To counteract these effects, the Cloud Knights take medicinal pellets to suppress their innate fear when in combat.<br><br><b>Technology</b><br><br>The borisin are particularly skilled at biotechnology, and perform various body modifications upon themselves. borisin armor and weapons both have characteristics of living entities.<br><br>Their ships are known as mechabeasts or beast ships. These are biological spaceships with the ability to feed, attack, and reproduce. The borisin's combat vessels for everyday hunting are also known for their rapid velocity.<br><br><b>Politics</b><br><br>The borisin have a tribal council system, with many ancient cultural traditions centering around the strong preying on the weak, or respect for force.<br>A single tribe is called a \"Pack,\" and a multitribal entity is called a \"Great Pack.\"<br>The borisin often select the most cunning and strong to lead their Pack: The Brood Lord. For a Great Pack, the leadership selection process forces the competing Brood Lords to fight each other, ranking them from top to bottom based on strength. A Great Pack leader is called \"Father Wolf\" or \"Warhead.\"<br><br><br>(Two lines of postscripts are recorded at the bottom of the dossier)<br><br><i>\"The last Warhead, Hoolay, has been interned and now the new Warhead is...?\"</i><br><i>\"Anecdotal accounts seem to suggest that it's Angsin or Leesa. — Qingzu\"</i>"

They are a rare species among the Abominations of Abundance, belonging to the order of Shapeless and the race of Extraneous Demons. Their original planet remains unknown.<br><br>As indicated by its biological classification, heliobi are pure energy entities without a set form. Records from many civilizations have named them \"The Shapeless\" or \"Starfire Essence.\" The heliobi love to parasitize others and control bodies of blood and flesh (commonly a humanoid sentient race), experiencing through this the various alterations of the nervous system triggered by emotions. This behavior of \"emotion consumption\" satiates the shapeless heliobi. The host will uncontrollably conduct stimulating behaviors (such as binge-eating, impulsiveness, self-mutilation, or destruction...) to please the heliobi within them, in exchange for the heliobi's powerful abilities. The process of heliobi taming the host's psyche is a process of expending the host's physical body without replenishment.<br><br>According to <i>History of the Xianzhou</i>, our contact with the heliobi can be traced back to the Lone Voyage Era before the Xianzhou natives turned into a long-life species. At that time, the nine Xianzhou ships sailing among the stars came into contact with various outrageous and miraculous lifeforms, including the heliobi. This race penetrated the ships' vaults to appear before our ancestors, declaring themselves a shapeless and rootless race, beseeching Xianzhou to give them a safe berth. The heliobi are adept at creating mirages and illusions to tempt humans. Thus, humans became addicted to these wondrous creatures of pure energy and indulged in frolicking with them.<br><br>But they soon exposed their true colors. The heliobi tried to take humans' bodies, drain their emotions, and control their will. Such is the so-called \"Possession Tragedy,\" from which the Xianzhou Zhuming suffered the greatest. Thankfully, the Xianzhou artisans ultimately bound the heliobi within shapeless prisons and sentenced them to provide energy for Xianzhou for all eternity.<br><br>This lasted till the end of the Flaming Catastrophe War against the Denizens of Abundance, when a hero broke the seal binding the heliobi, made an alliance with them, and relied on their power to defeat the army of Muldrasil*. After that campaign, the heliobi was also severely diminished. Its leaders were once again imprisoned and sealed in the various Xianzhou ships' Shackling Prisons. It cannot be ascertained whether any remnants may have escaped from the Xianzhou, but no traces of them have been found among the stars since.<br><br><i>*Note: A small number of academics believe in the legend that the Reignbow Arbiter is none other than this anonymous Xianzhou hero ascended, with the sign of their divinity being the Lux Arrow they fired to sever the Ambrosial Arbor. This myth must not be believed.</i><br><br><b>Physiology</b><br><br>When heliobi appear, electrical equipment will detect some sort of highly-intensive electromagnetic wave emission. As a creature of the Shapeless order, it can avoid the emission range of visible light and disappear from human sight. However, in order for the host to notice them, they would usually appear as a ball of heatless teal \"fire.\" That is also why they are called \"Starfire Essence.\"<br><br>Like how humans push physical objects, individual heliobi can also alter the energy balance of an area, freely converting energy from one type to another. Through manipulating energy, they can create visual images, make fire or ice, and produce vibration. This made heliobi appear as gods or demons to primitive civilizations. Based on the size of an individual's \"fire,\" one can judge the strength of that heliobus and how much energy it can master.<br><br>As an individual heliobus possesses more and more hosts over time, it would also slowly develops a personality and become distinctly different from its kin. Records in the Ten-Lords Commission surmise that this race learns from the hosts' brains through their parasitism.<br><br><b>Technology</b><br><br>The heliobi have never developed any technology. They have a certain level of repulsion against advanced technical equipment due to the race's ability to manipulate energy.<br><br><b>Politics</b><br><br>Though heliobi are recognized as an Abomination of Abundance, they rarely appeared as a part of the Denizens of Abundance's legions. On the contrary, they had once allied with Xianzhou. (For a very short duration only. See above for the specific circumstances.)<br><br>It has been at least six thousand years since the heliobi were subdued, making it virtually impossible to study its social organization. Some records indicate that individual heliobus can fuse with each other to create a bigger \"fire.\"<br><br><br>(A few lines of postscripts are recorded at the bottom of the dossier)<br><br><i>\"I heard the Xianzhou Zhuming has one of these demons sealed inside?\"</i><br><i>\"That's right. Folks from the Zhuming call it Flint Emperor. Actually, doesn't our Artisanship Commission still have prisons like that?\" — Qingzu</i><br><i>\"That's pretty dangerous...\"</i><br><i>\"Well, Zhuming residents do love to play with fire...\" — Qingzu</i>"

Their original planet remains unknown. According to currently available information, wingweavers reside in a living tree-shaped world named Muldrasil. Through the outstretched branches of Muldrasil, the armies of the wingweavers warp to different worlds to plunder resources and lives.<br><br>In the wingweavers' culture, any terrestrial sentient races that cannot fly are called \"Residents of Dirt,\" while the wingweavers call themselves the \"Cloudlords.\" They enslave other sentient races, making these races produce resources and maintain their world tree.<br><br>Based on the fragmented historical records in the <i>History of the Xianzhou</i>, our first contact with the wingweavers can be traced back to the Primeval Imperium Era before the Xianzhou fleet set sail. \"Winged barbarians arrived from beyond the sky, slaughtered and plundered, and conducted evils uncountable. The sovereign raised armies and annihilated the invaders, imprisoning numerous magicians of the feathered ones and obtaining their miraculous recipes...\" This is the reason the Xianzhou fleet set sail. The sovereign whose name has been erased from history dispatched our ancestors to seek immortality from a god in the deep stellar seas.<br><br>The wingweavers invaded the Xianzhou fleet for the second time during the Flaming Catastrophe War. They cast down their branches and almost annihilated the Luofu. If the Reignbow's Lux Arrow had not arrived and severed the Ambrosial Arbor, the war would have ended the Luofu.<br><br>The Yuque's Divination Commission observed the destruction of Muldrasil at around year 5320 of Star Calendar. The Antimatter Legion destroyed the wingweavers' home almost instantly. Since then, many wingweavers have become lost wanderers in space, reduced to mercenaries and intergalactic pirates.<br><br><b>Physiology</b><br><br>Compared to standard humans, the wingweavers' anatomical features are more akin to that of birds. They possess highly-developed back muscles, a pair (or multiple pairs) of feathered wings, elongated feet, and powerful toe structures that can push them off the ground.<br><br>The wingweavers are masters of flight, with cruise speed up to 400 kilometers per hour. Their bones and muscles contain special vacuoles that allow them to perform rapid dives and astounding bursts of acceleration. Similarly, such structures allow them to fly and move in the vacuum of outer space. (They still need to periodically leave vacuum environments to obtain air).<br><br>Cloud Knights need to be mindful of the following two points when fighting wingweavers: Be weary of their volleys when fighting from a distance, and suppress their flight and mobility using our advantage in weight and stamina when fighting in melee.<br><br><b>Technology</b><br><br>The technology that the wingweavers demonstrated in intergalactic warfare allows us to deduce that their civilization had experienced a great decline.<br><br>On the one hand, they possess \"branches\" that allow them to space warp. On the other hand, their resource supplies and weapon manufacturing are completely reliant on plundering external parties, or on trade with other Denizens of Abundance. They are found to have been equipped with the weapons and armors of borisin during all three Denizens of Abundance Wars.<br><br><b>Politics</b><br><br>The wingweavers allot their positions in Muldrasil strictly according to their social structure.<br><br>The one residing at the topmost branch is the master of the holy celestine nest, the Wingperor of the wingweavers. Traditionally, he (or she) is considered an Emanator of Abundance. They are responsible for guiding Muldrasil's growth and making it thrive, and for nurturing all the winged people. Under them are the Sky-Defenders (the warrior class), the Hymn-Singers (the academics and secretaries), the Infant-Nurturers (the servant class), and the Bough-Pickers (the laborers). Below Muldrasil's five major castes are the Residents of Dirt, the lowest of the low — including all sentient races from other worlds that do not possess the ability to fly.<br><br>As Muldrasil has been destroyed, the exact political structures of the wingweavers are no longer clear. The IPC's intelligence mentioned that all wingweavers scattered throughout the universe now belong to a certain wingweaver's mercenary company.<br><br><br>(A few lines of postscripts are recorded at the bottom of the dossier)<br><br><i>\"And what of the relationship between Muldrasil and the Ambrosial Arbor...?\"</i><br><i>\"There is no concrete evidence to indicate they are related.

Meanwhile, on the other side were some 300 billion of the coarse, reduced to pieces of meat, who barely comprehended their own existence. The celestial traces granted by the Ambrosial Arbor could never satisfy human greed, and Xianzhou became a bloated, sinking fleet — not even all the delves in the world could keep up with the population growth, and the plan to colonize new frontier planets with the coarse to ease population pressure was like trying to boil the ocean. According to calculations, these worlds would suffer the same fate as Xianzhou within three generations.<br><br>Ultimately, what later generations called the Civil War broke out. Families and cliques on the eight Xianzhou ships bickered and fought each other, the coarse rioted, and the Yuanqiao was tragically destroyed as it plunged into a red giant star. It was precisely at this delicate moment in time that the first case of mara-struck was recorded in history.<br><br>Based on records from \"The Three Sufferings\" chapter inside the <i>History of the Xianzhou</i>, the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Master of the Delves (<i>NB: This rank of nobility, back when such things existed, has been lost to the annals of time.</i>) Changhuan loved to wine, dine, and make merry. Not even an attack on the delve could stop him from hosting his thousandth birthday party, and he invited many guests. At the banquet, the nobles looked forlorn as they barely touched their dishes. Only the host, with glazed eyes, swallowed everything before him as he ate several humans' weight in food and drink — as though consigning it all to a bottomless pit, yet still not satisfying his appetite.<br><br>By the time the guards had been routed and the palace gates bashed down, those who broke in found nobody there.

This period came to be known as the \"Age of the Null,\" and the glorious Xianzhou civilization with its Ambrosial Arbor fell into its darkest days.<br><br>This madness — later coined as mara — began to plague the minds of every long-life Xianzhou native like a living nightmare that is impossible to rid.<br><br>...<br>..."

                "Desc": "Dear Citizens,<br><br>It's human nature to love animals. Hoping animals can be freed comes from a sense of compassion. An old Xianzhou saying goes, \"A nobleman steers clear of the kitchen.\" An ancient classic from the Primeval Imperium Age, <i>Signs of the Netherealm</i>, tells of a sage imploring a hunter to release his quarry. Examples would be too numerous to list, all of which demonstrate the traditional virtue of the Xianzhou natives in caring for all living things.<br><br>However, we must be careful with how we care for animals. The illegal release of animals back into their natural environs may seem like a meritorious deed, but it actually bears several serious consequences.<br><br>In March last year, a criminal suspect Mr. Chai (461 years old) smuggled twenty Nosewalkers he'd purchased into the Ever-Hunt Plains with the intent of release into nature.<br><br>Nosewalkers, originated from the planet Hyai'i, have recently been introduced aboard the Xianzhou as a popular alien pet. But this seemingly cute, docile, and harmless pet actually has a dark side: Its size expands with that of its surrounding living space. When the Cloud Knights' hunting squad located the first of the nosewalkers, the largest had already grown to the size of two starskiffs.<br><br>Based on data published by the Hyai'i Federal Bureau of Biology and Medicine, the largest nosewalker ever recorded is half the size of the Luofu. Can you imagine the devastating consequences were Mr. Chai to release one of these animals onto the Ever-Hunt Plains? Or stepping back a mile, even if the animal itself isn't harmful, is there any way we can be sure of any unforeseen genetic reactions? We cannot.<br><br>Upon arrest, Mr. Chai pled that he was acting in good faith. We believe that most of these animal releases are well-meaning, but it's precisely this kind of goodwill that could bring immeasurable losses to the Xianzhou.<br><br>There is also a rumor circulating around the city that only alien species released in Xianzhou are harmful, and the release of Xianzhou-native animals cannot cause any harm.<br><br>This idea could not be further from the truth. In July, a criminal suspect Mr. Ling (242 years old) bought schools and schools of lightfish at the farmers' markets, and together with some other animal liberation activists released the fish without authority into the seas at Scalegorge Waterscape.<br><br>I trust that anyone with a hint of common sense can immediately realize how ignorant and cruel an act it is to release large volumes of carnivorous fish into the Scalegorge Waterscape waters. Therefore, despite the actions of Mr. Ling and his conspirators bearing out no serious repercussions, they must still be punished to the full extent of the law to serve as an example to others.<br><br>The Realm-Keeping Commission reiterates to all citizens: Only professionals are qualified to release animals (officially termed \"reintroduction into the wild\"), and any private release of animals is illegal — possibly even criminal!<br><br>We hope all citizens understand: Please care for animals rationally and scientifically, because ignorant kindness is often more dangerous than rational malice.<br><br>Realm-Keeping Commission Publicity Department"

You don't know what else you can do. How would I know what I did to offend you? You don't even think to call me \"Robe Brethren.\"</i><br><br>This piece is set on the Xianzhou Yaoqing at the end of the Three Sufferings Era. Taking the perspective of a Zhuming foxian man, the piece recounts the story of how he joined the largest Brotherhood in the Yaoqing and became its legendary ringleader as a Yaoqing non-native. The eminent Mr. Wan Yi is one of the first creators who managed to put the art of Butterfly Immersia on the map of artistic appreciation. He pioneered the technology of the Empathy Matrix in this piece, significantly slowing the subjective perceptions of time for experiencers, thus launching Butterfly Immersias into an age of long stories.<br><br>During the Three Sufferings Era, the social order of the Xianzhou was close to collapsing. In the absence of a social order, organized crime rapidly filled the void and quickly rose up to build their own underground kingdoms. These criminal syndicates are collectively called the Brotherhood, with their ringleader being the Robe Brethren.<br><br>Four millennia have passed since. Under the protection of the Reignbow Arbiter, the Xianzhou realms had long returned to lawfulness and peace. Terms like the Brotherhood and Robe Brethren had faded into the sands of time, becoming one of the many historical terminologies.<br><br>However, as they have disappeared in society, the Robe Brethrens have embedded themselves in the depth of Xianzhou's soul as a cultural symbol. Members of the Brotherhood often speak a frightening but decorous Yaoqing dialect. Even in the modern era, one can still see teens trolling the streets and crudely imitating the Yaoqing dialect and fragments of the Brotherhood's tacit creed.<br><br>In my opinion, what they were reminiscing is not the cruel, chaotic, and lawless era, but the resilience, valor, and honor of these Robe Brethrens. However, these portrayals are merely the playwright's romantic interpretations."

At that time, Ms. Bashir Bassett was probably the most popular dramatist in Interastral Peace Entertainment, and <i>Verdantia</i> indeed showed her profound dramaturgy.<br><br>On the other hand, Mr. Yuan Bo's handling of war scenes and perspective switching in this work has also become the basic teaching material for countless Butterfly Immersia students in later generations.<br><br>However, we can still say that this Butterfly Immersia piece is a special product that could only be made in that era.

A young foxian girl, Yingzhen, was a rare mathematical genius, but her future in the academy was cut short due to a moment of confusion. foxians of the time were still traveling merchants on the Xianzhou, while Yingzhen, who had to become a traveling merchant, gradually learned how to apply her mathematical knowledge to business. Eventually, Yingzhen founded the Whistling Flames that soon became a business magnate on the Xianzhou, and her book, <i>Lolling Grass</i>, became a compulsory textbook for every merchant on the Xianzhou.<br><br>Before <i>Lolling Grass</i>, biographical immersias usually focus on heroes, soldiers, pilots, and even bandits or evildoers as protagonists, and their plot is usually about their action-packed lives charged with emotions. A characteristic of these biographical immersias is that they tend to allow the experiencers to experience the magnificent historical moments, rather than allowing one to feel the life journey of the protagonists.<br><br><i>Lolling Grass</i> changed the industry in that it is a biographical immersia with a core theme on commerce, but moved away from the rivalry and intrigue of business development, instead focusing on the dry disciplines of mathematics and business as the main axis of the plot, allowing the experiencers to step into Yingzhen's perspective and experience her journey firsthand to achieve conceptual breakthroughs in these disciplines.<br><br>I remember three hundred years ago, when my fellow students and I went to experience the <i>Lolling Grass</i>, we were all students of immersias, so our grasp on the esoteric arts of mathematics is not good. But when Yingzhen intuited The Study of Chess, we were all overcome by the ecstasy (and shock) of grasping the truth, to the point that we were quaking in our boots. This unique charm might be why the art of Butterfly Immersia cannot be replaced.<br><br>Another trivia: The popularity of <i>Lolling Grass</i> caused the Wen Sisters to soar in celebrity. This was why many sibling duo directors mushroomed in the Xianzhou within that century. It's a shame that few can reach the height that the Wen Sisters did."

It was said that loneliness was prominent in her later years as she continued to re-experience this immersia that starred herself until the eternal slumber finds her among the vivacity of this fantasy."

Thus, the Pearlkeepers were needed to protect their vulnerable compatriots. Crane used to be a Cloud Knight, but returned to Scalegorge Waterscape to be a Pearlkeeper after retiring. One day, during a routine inspection, Crane came upon some unusual signs. At that time, she didn't know that it was because an evil beast that had been sleeping underwater for thousands of years had awakened... Crane had to join forces with her comrades to battle the evil beast in the dark ancient sea, and protect the vulnerable sacred land of Scalegorge Waterscape.<br><br><i>Deep Water</i> is possibly the first immersia of the evil beast genre. Director Yong Zheng and screenwriter Fu Rong could even be called the inventors of the said genre. In addition to this, <i>Luofu Monster</i>, <i>Heliobus Ingenia</i>, and <i>Xianzhou Predator</i> that they collaborated on are also widely regarded as classic evil beast immersias.<br><br>How to impart the sense of overwhelming oppression of evil beasts, how to use the dark and mysterious environment to invoke terror (such as the ancient sea of Scalegorge Waterscape in <i>Deep Water</i>), and how to shape the moment when human beings fall into fear and burst into courage when facing evil beasts... It is no wonder that scholars of the immersia genre have a saying: \"Memorize all the immersias of Yong Zheng, and you will master evil beast immersias.\"<br><br>Another point worth mentioning about <i>Deep Water</i>:<br><br>The art of Butterfly Immersia is loved by all races in the Xianzhou Alliance, the directors of almost all immersias are foxians.<br><br>This is inevitable... After all, the filming and production of Butterfly Immersias rely on foxians' innately keen mental prowess. Focusing on and regulating the fantasy world requires extraordinary meticulousness and ability. Without this ability, making a immersia is tantamount to creating music for the hard of hearing or painting for the hard of seeing... Strictly speaking, it is not impossible, but very difficult.<br><br>Yong Zheng is undoubtedly an exception. As Vidyadhara, he has become one of the greatest directors in the history of Butterfly Immersia. It is hard to imagine how many difficulties he had overcome to achieve such great success.<br><br>foxian directors account for an overwhelming majority in the immersia industry. This also leads to another problem: Before Yong Zheng debuted, most of the Butterfly Immersias told the story of foxians from the perspective of foxians. After all, people are better at and more willing to create characters they are familiar with. However, all of Yong Zheng's works in his creative career are from a Vidyadhara's perspective.<br><br>Be it Crane, the brave and fearless Pearlkeeper in <i>Deep Water</i>, or Linda, the Vidyadhara scientist who was attacked by their own crazed experiment in <i>The Xianzhou Predator</i>, they have all become classic characters in the history of immersia. After Yong Zheng became a household name, more and more works began to bravely choose to tell stories from the perspective of non-foxians."

Now, he is almost unable to think about anything smoothly, and can only endure the nibbling away of the plague.

It dives deep into people's hearts, explores fears and desires, and shows how a person can achieve self-consistency and reconciliation even in the last moments of their life.

I would like to teach you to be ever victorious, brave, and enduring.</i><br><br>About four thousand to five thousand years ago, the Xianzhou experienced the chaotic Three Sufferings Era. From a wider perspective, the collapse of social order on each Xianzhou ship is an insignificant bit of history. Instead, the bloody battle of life and death was the tone of that era. Reignbow Arbiter was not Reignbow Arbiter at that time, but a mortal hero. Reignbow Arbiter led the Xianzhou people during the magnificent confrontation with the Denizens of Abundance, which ultimately destroyed the giant tree \"Muldrasil\" of the Wingweavers at the cost of self-burning, but saving the Xianzhou Alliance. <i>Reignbow Arbiter</i> is an epic immersia based on this legend.<br><br>To this day, there are still a group of fundamentalists who think that Reignbow Arbiter is an immersia that blasphemes Reignbow Arbiter. This is because it allows the experiencer to enter the perspective of Reignbow Arbiter to experience the epic final battle as Reignbow Arbiter, and even experience the process of Reignbow Arbiter's rise to the godhood after death, which can be said to be disrespectful.<br><br>But in reality, only by experiencing this powerful epic from such a perspective can the experiencer truly appreciate how much blood Reignbow Arbiter and the brave people of Xianzhou shed to achieve the current peace for the Xianzhou to rest and recuperate.<br><br>But even putting aside the vexatiousness of these fundamentalists, <i>Reignbow Arbiter</i> remains a controversial masterpiece. The biggest controversy is that when Yu Chun wrote the script, the historical facts were modified based on personal preference, which is considered unacceptable to many experiencers.<br><br>For example, Yu Chun downplayed the existence of the heliobi leader, the \"Flint Emperor\" in the entire immersia. Yu Chun even summed up the arrow of Reignbow Arbiter that destroyed the Ambrosial Arbor as \"an advanced awakening of an Aeon's power in a mortal body,\" which is an obvious violation of historical facts. At present, historians generally believe that the arrow at that time borrowed the power of the Flint Emperor, but Yu Chun personally dislikes heliobi and revised that part of the story.<br><br>However, flaws cannot detract from the beauty. Controversial masterpieces are still masterpieces. But in my personal view, I still hope that you can read some more reliable historical materials (such as <i>Ode to Reignbow Path</i>) before experiencing <i>Reignbow Arbiter</i> to avoid being misled by this immersia's dramatized version of events."

On the one hand, autobiographies possess strong subject matters specific to the protagonist, which is considered to hinder the substitution of the experiencer. On the other hand, at that time, Robe Brethren immersias had not yet gone out of fashion yet. This led them to worry that such a subversive Robe Brethren immersia would not have a particularly good box office response.<br><br>In the end, Zi Run had to pay out of pocket to film the immersia.

He quietly made a vow to devote the rest of his life's effort on the space station to the pursuit of unique scientific research results. Unfortunately, the \"rest of his life\" turned out to be longer than expected, perhaps even amounting to eternity.<br><br>We know not what sort of experimental accident he faced at the time, but we can confirm that this \"accident\" was a necessary prerequisite for the story that follows. To deduce past events, you might need to use a little imagination — Perhaps it was a Curio capable of \"mental projection,\" or perhaps the project he was working on was itself related to the topic of \"mental projection.\" He pushed the button with anticipation, thinking that the data he had dreamed of would appear on the screen, but what he did not expect was the beginning of a tragedy.<br><br>The Security Department records show that among the accidents that have occurred in the space station, there have many deaths of researchers, but not once has there been a clear record of a researcher \"disappearing into thin air.\" But his body did, in fact, disappear, and no one knows where he went. Moreover, no one had any records of his experience. Perhaps to this day, a shadow of it still remains in the dust of the space station. What a cruel twist of fate. He completed the final step of the experiment by himself — his mind was completely projected into an object.<br><br>Just imagine, what kind of experience would it be if you could only \"observe\" what's happening in front of you, but couldn't interact with it or act in line with your own thoughts? The answer: It's torture! The mind is trapped in a \"prison,\" but what do the thoughts represent? What kind of receptacle can carry formless thoughts? Nobody knows the answer.<br><br>However, this casts a shadow over the space station. Who would like to have a cup filled with a human's negative thoughts instead of piping hot coffee?<br><br>A researcher responded that he had heard strange noises near the security door of the department. He described the sound as a \"shrill incessant wailing,\" like the cries of some strange creature. My assistant and I quickly completed the interview and investigation, and visited the mysterious and rowdy security door again. However, the situation was regrettable for everyone there. We did not find any suspicious phenomenon, nor any evidence that could support the theory of \"mental projection.\" Under the relentless in-depth investigation of my assistant and I, we finally found a lone Wubbaboo near the security door, who kept making \"woo woo\" sounds. However, one of the researchers, in their exhaustion, mistook this for crying, which eventually led to this wild goose chase.<br><br><i>The author hereby requests: Ghost stories need to be debunked, and work needs to be moderated!

But we did visit that mysterious room. The moment when I opened the door, I was actually full of fear and apprehension: Could it be a trap? Or maybe it was a place for some of the space station's under-the-table activities? Alas, in order to reveal the truth to my friends and readers, I went on in.<br><br>It turned out that it was just an ordinary room, and there was a researcher from the Department of Implement Arts, who was trying to track down the \"toilet.\" Rather, its correct name was \"Experiment 13\"... After patiently talking with the researcher, the full story was uncovered — the mysterious \"toilet\" was a Curio borrowed by the Department of Implement Arts for a confidential experiment, code-named \"Experiment 13.\" Due to a mistake by the researcher in the experiment, Experiment 13 caused all kinds of rumors throughout the space station.<br><br>But is that the whole truth behind the researcher's explanation?

I went up and found out they were selling pets.<br><br>The animal I saw looked like a house cat, but its body was much smaller. It was lying down on a mat in a bamboo cage, purring and meowing affectionately. However, after the Ambrosial Arbor took root, most of the Xianzhou people preferred large and strong pets. I asked the Balladian why this animal was so small, and if anyone had shown interest in buying it.<br><br>The person responded that it is true that Xianzhou people like large and strong pets, but there are also those who love petite and delicate ones. Now that he saw the sparkle in my eyes, he expected that I must be the latter. Perhaps it was fate? I couldn't refuse.<br><br>The person also said that this small animal is called a grimalkin, and it was one of the species that the ancestors of Xianzhou loved to keep during the Primeval Imperium Era. Today, the strong Xianzhou house cat evolved from this small grimalkin. This was in line with what I'd read in old texts. However, the grimalkin had been extinct for many years. This made me suspicious, and I inquired about its origin.<br><br>The person swore to me that though grimalkins were extinct in Xianzhou, they were bred on many other planets. This animal is truly just an ordinary white grimalkin. It was neither genetically modified, nor was it an invasive species, so I could rest assured.<br><br>How could I turn down looking after a long-extinct little animal to help continue its lineage — especially after petting those tender little paws?<br><br>Eventually, I paid hefty sum for the grimalkin, named it \"Mimi,\" and took it home.

I'm convinced that my efforts in training are not inferior to anyone else's... But I just can't defeat Youshan, that tiny Vidyadhara who's only up to my chest in height. He's only lived for a little over sixty years, while I have been practicing with the spear for centuries, and even modified my body according to the Cloud Knights Martial Doctrine.<br><br>My instructor had said many times that \"the sword requires nimbleness and speed, while the spear demands solidness and strength.\" Flying Swords controlled by one's qi require the dexterity of a fast reflex. Spears, on the other hand, necessitate power and control. Mitigating the explosive burst of recoil that comes from the spear tip entering the enemy's body also demands intense physical training from the wielder.<br><br>I understand that Xianzhou natives can never stand toe-to-toe with foxians in terms of reflexes, but I never anticipated to lose to a Vidyadhara when it comes to strength.<br><br>I didn't lose to Youshan because of a lack of skill or training. It was purely due to the differences between our muscular structures. The Vidyadhara hatch in the Scalegorge Waterscape's ancient sea under intense water pressure and are always capable of swimming under such conditions, making their strength incompatible to us Xianzhou natives who have only ever lived on land.<br><br>I will never be able to overcome the vast differences between our genes even if I trained for centuries more. Such is my sad fate... Destined to never become the strongest.<br><br>...<br><br><b>April 2</b><br><br>An alchemist friend of mine from the Alchemy Commission recommended me a medicine called the Draught of Draconic Surge. He said taking this medicine can give me the power of dragons.<br><br>As if realizing how the medicine's name made me upset, he declared with a smile that he will give me this medicine for free if I can guess what ingredients went into it. He squinted and made faces, and tried to get me to make outrageous guesses.<br><br>How am I supposed to know what kind of tricks these alchemists are trying to pull? I didn't buy his medicine.<br><br>Draught of Draconic Surge... I hate that name. The Vidyadhara worship Long the dragon, and consider themselves descendants of the Aeon... Bah! I just can't help but think about Youshan as soon as I hear the word \"dragon.\"<br><br>He's been promoted to a captain. Our instructor said he will recommend Youshan to take over his own job as a drill instructor. Youshan must be feeling great right now. He always feigns politeness when he sees me and addresses me as his senior frater, but I know he's trying to hide his sarcastic expression. I hate him so much.<br><br>I could hardly contain my urge to sink my spear tip into his body when we sparred. However, I couldn't do it. I couldn't beat Youshan.<br><br>I challenged Youshan three times during training and lost every single time. It wasn't a surprise. I sat for a long time alone under the sparring stage.<br><br>...<br><br><br><b>June 12</b><br><br>I did it! I can do it! I did it!<br><br>I beat Youshan!<br><br>The Draught of Draconic Surge is a miracle medicine! I admit, when I got the injection and the concoction entered my veins, I felt I was going to explode into pieces from a gale that stormed through my insides. But that discomfort was only momentary. After that, I suddenly felt the spear in my hand was as light as a needle. I twirled it a few times, and my peers couldn't even handle a single attack from me.<br><br>I became so fast and so strong! Hahaha! Even Youshan was no match for me!<br><br>Now that I look at him, his movements are as slow as an ant's. I can just stretch out my hand and press down on him, slowly grinding him into mince meat with the tip of my spear. What a pity that our instructor stopped our spar. He got a military doctor to do a check-up on me, but they didn't find out anything.<br><br>Hmph. Old timers are always sticklers for the rules. According to my friend, I can challenge even more people if I keep using this medicine!<br><br>I heard that there's a retainer in the Seat of Divine Foresight with great aptitude for the sword.

Those aren't myths. In ancient times, the Xianzhou natives were able to attain such a state of being.<br><br>However, I am far from enlightened on a physical level.<br><br>In order to reach such extremes, I have to ingest the secret medicine and keep training harder.<br><br>It is not about the mind or mysteries. Everything is about the strength of the body — That's the enlightenment I received from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus's way of immortality.<br><br>Only Merciful Medicus can help me to reach or even surpass that limit.<br><br>I got to know many brothers and sisters from all walks of the Xianzhou, and some are even Outworlders. We came together with divergent goals: Some came to save lives, some to take revenge on their enemies, some admire the master primus's charisma as a leader, and some are simply passionate adherents of Sanctus Medicus... or obsessed opponents of the Devilish Archer Author. And then there are people like me who seek enlightenment.<br><br>We support each other in making the medicines, hiding from the authorities, and worshiping Sanctus Medicus. None here question the others' convictions, and none mock the others' goals... This made my life in \"civil society\" look like a joke.<br><br>I have to admit that it's very painful to ingest these medicines. Just swallowing the disgusting fluids is already comparable to swallowing needles. They burn throughout my body, as if my internal organs are being boiled alive. And once I manage to push down the strong urge to throw it up, the raw agony of my muscles being separated from my skeleton comes next. Lastly, my bones would dash against each other like rocky boulders, as if they could shatter in the next second. Every one of their collisions sends a jolt straight to my brain, yet I cannot simply faint to evade this pain.<br><br>However, after a few hours of agony, the increase in my bodily capacities is very apparent.<br><br>If I interpret this pain as condensing hundreds and thousands of years' worth of training into a few hours, then it doesn't seem as unbearable anymore.<br><br>...<br><br><b>September 10</b><br><br>Strength became stronger.

                "Desc": "Before we talk about the pharmacology behind the Draught of Draconic Surge, we must step back a little and discuss the principles behind longevity.<br><br>For most creatures of flesh and blood in the cosmos, longevity often is an indicator of something else — cancer. It describes cells proliferating beyond their designated lifespan and order, becoming immortal, and eating away at the host's body until both perish.<br><br>In fact, after tens of thousands of years of competition as well as trial and error, some cancerous cells have mutated to be capable of living independently of a host, and can even corrode other creatures with their longevity. Year 7142 of the Star Calendar saw a serious plague erupting on the planet of Yaguoret, which was under the Intelligentsia Guild's rule. It was later discovered that the vector was a type of cancer cell originating from a creature of the Anthozoa subphylum, and had gained the capacity to cross the species barrier due to a chance mutation.<br><br>From a purely medical standpoint, us long-life species are entirely composed of immortal cells, yet we maintain an equilibrium within our bodies. This is quite an impossible feat.<br><br>Put simply, the secret of the Xianzhou natives and foxians is that our cells can shift as needed between differentiated cells and stem cells. This conversion obeys specific rules that will never create a single error.<br><br>The rule dictating this conversion is the ultimate secret among secrets. It is not set according to internal hormonal levels or any other parameters, but a \"standard\" set in stone the moment the individual was born. As the cells shift between differentiation and omnipotence, the person's bodily characteristics are forever set at their original \"standard.\"<br><br>We call this phenomenon, which goes against the fundamental creed of biology, as the miracle of the Plagues Author. At a certain critical point of the long-life species' life cycle, this power from the Plagues Author will suddenly enter a new stage — The original standard will be over-written and the body will start to develop catastrophically, turning a civilized \"human\" into a mindless \"abomination.\" This is what we commonly call \"mara-struck.\"<br><br>It is commonly thought that the source of Vidyadhara's immortality is different from that of Xianzhou natives and foxians. The Vidyadhara race did not gain immortality from the Plagues Author. Instead, as the descendants of Long the dragon, the majesty of Permanence flows in their blood.<br><br>Due to this unique characteristic, Vidyadhara also exhibit a life cycle different from other long-life species. Their life, consisting of reverting from maturity to an infantile stage in an unending cycle, relies upon continuous cellular transdifferentiation. This is the reason why Vidyadhara do not face the ailments of immortality that many other long-life species have to contend with.<br><br>The core principle of the Draught of Draconic Surge is to transfer this draconic power into a different organism. Daiyu angelica, frost mulberry, and lunarescent sea cucumber... All these ingredients have only one core purpose, which is to maintain and re-animate the stem cells within the Vidyadhara bone marrow, allowing it to function within the host after the injection.<br><br>For long-life species, this medication can trigger mara in a more controlled manner, making the bodily organs \"go out of control in a more controlled manner\" under the dragons' guidance, instead of growing haphazardly with the Plagues Author's power. The host would then gain power only available to the mara-struck while retaining their sanity.<br><br>As for short-life species, this medication would forcibly graft the power of the dragons into their body. This brutal transplantation will cause a rapid elevation of bodily capacities for a short duration, significantly improving the short-life species' fragile physiologies. However, once the cells from Long's Scions have all perished to the host's immune system, the host's physiology will suffer a catastrophic regression. The only thing that can suppress or revert such a decline might be the other miracle drugs developed by the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.<br><br>As stated above, though the Seat of Divine Foresight tasked me to analyze the pharmacology of this medicine with the likely goal of preparing an antidote, no \"antidote\" can possibly exist for the Draught of Draconic Surge. The core of this medication's pharmacology is to manually trigger mara in people using the power of dragons.<br><br>If we can prepare an antidote for such a medication, then being stricken with mara will no longer be a fatal condition.<br><br>Dan Shu"

How can you say that I am at fault?\" Chang Hong slammed the table and stood up in a huff of rage.<br><br>Huanhuan also stood up when she saw her husband getting accused, and she rebuked loudly. \"My husband may not be the most virtuous person in town, but he's not one to hurt other people! Angler, did your brain shrink together with your stature?\"<br><br>\"How dare you talk like this!?\" Seeing this, Ma Zhao stood up as well and glared at Huanhuan as he replied. \"If The Angler is saying your husband did this, then he must have already found concrete evidence!\"<br><br>Ma Zhao was a tall fellow, and his head almost reached the ceiling. Seeing this angry giant, Huanhuan shut her mouth and quietly sat down again. However, as this affected his future, Chang Hong had to steel himself and keep talking.<br><br>\"Dear Angler, becoming mara-struck is a natural event. I'm an artisan, and you were a healer before your incident, and we both have plenty of logic in us... I believe we can agree that humans can't affect such natural events.\"<br><br>The Angler waved his hand and signaled for Ma Zhao to sit down, then stared at Chang Hong dismissively until the latter wore an unsettled expression.<br><br>\"You are correct,\" The Angler began slowly. \"But while you cannot control ionic storms, you can trick pilots into flying into one. You cannot control meteors, but can make them into fatal bullets. You cannot control the process of becoming mara-struck... but can trigger it to start.\"<br><br>Chang Hong chuckled nervously. \"Hahaha. You must be kidding... Making someone mara-struck sounds like a secret that can only be known by the Ten-Lords Commission.\"<br><br>\"Your uncle Chang the Ninth has his business in medical ingredients. These are the medicines you asked him to buy.\" The Angler waved his hand and Ma Zhao immediately spread out a flexible display he was holding. A goods order was displayed on it.<br><br>The Angler stood up while Ma Zhao respectfully knelt on the ground, and lifted the flexible display for the other man to read. Pointing to the words on the display, the Angler explained. \"You are a smart and well-educated man. However, it's a pity you didn't use your talents on the right things. You went to the Xianzhou Fanghu and obtained a prescription from the Fanghu foxians. They have a unique medical tradition that most Luofu residents are unfamiliar with. That's how it slipped past Chang the Ninth, as well as the Realm-Keeping Commission, and even the Ten-Lords Commission... But it won't get past me.\"<br><br>\"What are you trying to say?\" Chang Hong had stopped smiling. He looked coldly at The Angler.<br><br>\"Langf dangf, dlax kid tad jad, and zend lel... In the Fanghu foxians' materia medica, this prescription treats \"daib pik zeib dongb.\" In our language, it means \"mania.\" The Angler flipped the page and continued with a leisurely tone. \"The Fanghu foxians would have called Yuanxia's symptoms... what was it... Ah, right. \"Hxat hvib.\" We would call it \"depression.\"<br><br>Ma Zhao became infused with rage upon hearing this. He bolted up, almost knocking The Angler aside, and shouted. \"You abomination! Yuanxia took the medicine you gave her without question because she trusted you! Who would have thought that you gave her something to make her worse!?\"<br><br>Chang Hong rebutted in desperation. \"Fine, Angler! Even if I gave her the wrong medicine and made her depression worse... would that have made her mara-struck? Surely you understand the simple logic that correlation doesn't equal causation!\"<br><br>The Angler was undaunted by Chang Hong's questions. \"Indeed, there has to be at least a few million depressed individuals on the Xianzhou. Most of them are living whole and hale, and have not become mara-struck. What you did was not limited to making Yuanxia's symptoms worse — that was only your first step.\"<br><br>\"What followed was the most important part of your plan. Your wife, Huanhuan, would go to Yuanxia's house a few times a week to drink tea and chat with her. You told Huanhuan to move some items in Yuanxia's house with every visit — adding some things, stealing some things, secretly replying to her private correspondences, committing to work tasks without her knowing... And every time she felt puzzled, you two would pretend to be innocent and declare it had nothing to do with you. Yuanxia trusted you so much that she never even doubted you.\"<br><br>\"Her life soon became pure chaos. She didn't know where her old comb went, and she couldn't recall when she bought a new mirror. She didn't know when she made specific commitments, and also couldn't recall why she was suddenly so rude to her boss. Then, combined with your \"miracle medicine\"... Yuanxia became literally insane thanks to you.\"<br><br>\"The saddest thing is that she never doubted the two of you even up to her last moments as a \"human.\" Indeed... who would have thought that someone as evil as you two could exist?\"<br><br>..."

For ease of reading and due to the length of the poem, the editors had split this work into sections based on progression of the narrative.<br><br>[†2] Langgan, Bigui, and Shatang are all mystic trees found in primeval imperium legends, with trunks made of jade and bearing fruits that grant immortality. The Daiyu, the Yuanqiao, and the Cangcheng are all Xianzhou ships that have been destroyed. The Daiyu exploded in 1200 Star Calendar during the campaign against the viscorpi, a Denizen of Abundance race. The Yuanqiao lost control during the Civil War in 3200 Star Calendar, plunging into a red giant and disappearing completely. The Cangcheng was devoured by the activated planet Rahu, Devourer of Worlds, in 6300 Star Calendar. This suggests that the ode was composed after 6300 Star Calendar, but it's also possible that later authors have amended the original.<br><br>[†3] This section describes the glorious days when the unnamed sovereign united the entire planet during the Primeval Imperium Age of the Xianzhou Alliance. \"Replacement by Aurumaton\" refers to the story of the sovereign's ban on all forms of weaponry and replacing security institutions with Aurumatons and Ingenia to maintain public order.<br><br>[†4] \"The divine race\" means the Wingweavers, one of the Denizens of Abundance races. Muldrasil is this race's home world, a planet-sized giant tree that draws energy from the stars. Here, we can see that the Denizens of Abundance had made contact with various Xianzhou clans as early as the Primeval Imperium Age.<br><br>[†5] \"Sanctus Medicus\" is the Plagues Author, one who presides over the Path of Abundance. Today, this title is mainly reserved for the henchmen of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.<br><br>[†6] \"From the budding shores where ambers are plucked\" refers to when Xianzhou observed the Celestial Comet Wall being built by the Aeon Qlipoth. \"Where void whales fend\" refers to the Xianzhou Alliance coming into contact with the void song whales around 500 Star Calendar. This event should have happened before \"ambers are plucked,\" but the poet inverted their order for linguistic flow. Also, based on historical records, the Reignbow Arbiter was born in approximately 1700 Star Calendar, and could not possibly have participated in the aforementioned events. This is evidently a misappropriation. This occurs repeatedly in the text from here on, and individual instances will not be noted further.<br><br>[†7] \"Puppets disempowered by iron mallets\" refers to the Xianzhou people wresting control of the ships from the Aurumatons, starting around 1400 Star Calendar and finishing with the Heliobi Wars. \"Slaying Viscorpi\" recounts the Xianzhou's battle against the viscorpi around 1200 Star Calendar.<br><br>[†8] The \"five Navium Astriger\" and the \"eight Xianzhou ships\" are figurative, used to represent the entire flotilla of the Xianzhou Alliance. This is not an actual count."

Another possible interpretation is the Divination Commission's \"Cloud Pavilion.\" It indicates how widespread the shockwave was felt.<br><br>[†6] Historical records show that the Xianzhou's suicide squad sent the weaponized auxiliary engine straight into the red star formed by the heliobi, causing it to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole.

This is describing how the seeds of the Ambrosial Arbor took root aboard the Xianzhou Luofu. However, the Xianzhou Luofu only became the flagship of the Alliance after receiving the Ambrosial Arbor. Here the sequence is reverted, probably out of artistic license.<br><br>[†3] The people of the Primeval Imperium used \"wild horses,\" \"fog,\" and \"clouds\" to refer generally to clouds, air, and dust. The structure of this sentence is inverted, with the gist being \"even clouds and dust grew eloquent through the Ambrosial Arbor's Elevation.\" According to historical records, the Xianzhou experimented with the Arbor's fruit, \"Elevating\" animals to the point of mimicking human sentience and speech. The line is probably referring to this event.<br><br>[†4] The motif of \"merged with the jade\" originated when the sage Xuan Yao embedding the jade abacus directly into the human skull to peer into the future. This is evidently a misappropriation. The \"Wisdomwalker\" is the one who presides over the Path of Erudition.<br><br>[†5] \"Crippled,\" \"defiled,\" \"maddened,\" \"mutated,\" and \"forgetfulness\" are the five symptoms of being mara-struck. \"Crippled\" means that, after suffering grave injuries from external violence, the body must utilize its self-healing capacities to undergo long and painful periods of repair. \"Defiled\" means that, due to the immortality of the flesh for the Xianzhou people, the body may be forced to eternally co-exist with incurable alien viruses or bacteria. \"Maddened\" means the person starts to feel anger and violent desires, and starts to have extreme mood swings. \"Mutated\" means the flesh is starting to produce mutated organs and can no longer maintain a stable humanoid form. \"Forgetfulness\" means the person's mind is taken over by a sense of emptiness, and spends their days in an oblivious daze. This section describes how, after the Reignbow became one with the jade, they saw the tragic future of the Xianzhou residents, where the people became mara-struck due to their immortality.<br><br>[†6] \"Mad against Diviners\" originates from a Xianzhou folk legend about a person who believed the Ambrosial Arbor to be an alien monstrosity. Opposed to longevity, they feigned madness to publicly express their ardent opinion. Here, \"Diviners\" generally refers to the Xianzhou aristocrats, and can be extended to include the Arbor's fruit, as the aristocrats were the first Xianzhou residents to receive the sacred fruit.<br><br>[†7] \"Ancient sovereign's obsession\" refers to the nameless sovereign who united the Primeval Imperium. The Reignbow believed that the Xianzhou residents were blinded by the seduction of an endless lifespan and were no different from the nameless sovereign's rapacious fear of death. This drove Reignbow furious.<br><br>[†8] This section describes the Reignbow's opposition to immortality, and how they shot an arrow into the Ambrosial Arbor to show their resolve. The Xianzhou aristocrats who had eaten the fruit of immortality grew enraged and convicted them. However, awed by the Reignbow's heroic exploits and prestige, they could only sentence the hero to continual hibernation. \"Watchful sleep\" refers to the rotating cryo-sleep system used when the Xianzhou Alliance first left its home world. \"Cold coffins\" are the cryo-sleep pods."

Once awakened, the Reignbow analyzed the situation and concocted a strategy to break the deadlock.<br><br>[†3] Reignbow ignored common advice, heading into the prison deep within the Xianzhou Zhuming and persuaded the imprisoned heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, to help the Xianzhou fight off the Denizens of Abundance. They made a deal and the Reignbow allowed the Flint Emperor to possess their physical body, in exchange for the power of the heliobi.<br><br>[†4] Inspired by the hero's sacrifice, many Xianzhou residents made the same heroic deal. They formed suicide squads and marched alongside the heliobi. They swore to shield the Xianzhou like the clouds veil the sky, forever aloft. This is the origin story of the name \"Cloud Knights.\"<br><br>[Postscript] <br>This part describes the \"Flaming Catastrophe,\" one of the Three Sufferings Era (approximately 3000 — 4000 Star Calendar). At the time, the Xianzhou Zhuming detected gravity waves from a massive object, but failed to capture any light signals. Only when the Xianzhou Alliance drew nearer did the stargazers realize that this massive object was a world of trees feeding off nearby stars. It was also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium — Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers.<br>What petrified the Xianzhou even more was that the ship behemoths of the viscorpi also appeared. The viscorpi were directed by the Wingweavers, and the two races were living in a symbiotic relationship. As if attracted by the power of the Ambrosial Arbor, Muldrasil slowly began approaching the Luofu, and the most epic battle in the history of Xianzhou soon broke out.<br>Fatigued from the Civil War (the \"Living Catastrophe\" of the Three Sufferings), the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, the Xianzhou residents were powerless to counter such a crisis. They released all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation — including the hero of this epic ode, the Reignbow."

Here, it refers to the Reignbow's weapon.<br><br>[†2] This line transitions rather bluntly. Together with the next line, it is possibly a speech by the Reignbow to boost morale before the battle. Another interpretation is that the Reignbow knew their death was near, and deliberately left their final words.<br><br>[†3] This may be the origin behind the common battle cries of the Cloud Knights — \"Xianzhou soars, Cloud Knight roars!\" and \"In valor and vigor, cleanse all ills!\" but it's also possible that later generations amended this. Academics hold different theories, and the order of the lines is still up for debate.<br><br>[†4] The historical record shows the battle formation during this war was in this order, from the nearest to Muldrasil to the furthest: The Yaoqing, the Luofu, the Yuque, the Zhuming, the Fanghu, the Cangcheng, and the Xuling. The Xuling and Fanghu were far from the frontlines. Other records point to the Reignbow firing their arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing. This line describes the size of the impact from the Reignbow's star-shattering shot, and how every ship in the Xianzhou Alliance was affected.<br><br>[†5] Based on historical records, the Reignbow's arrow smashed into the Ambrosial Arbor, penetrated the almighty beast, and severed the connection between the Luofu and Muldrasil. This ripped open a fissure into the void, and a monstrous wave of imaginary force spewed forth from it. This line describes that event.<br><br>[†6] Based on historical records, the Reignbow disappeared after shooting the arrow that turned the tide of battle, but the Flint Emperor had left behind part of their body. This line claims that the Xianzhou people could find neither of them. Perhaps this poem records mere rumor.<br><br>[†7] \"Ingot,\" \"Jiyuan,\" \"electromagnetic cloud,\" and \"circle\" in these two lines describe how the people of Xianzhou, in commemorating the Reignbow's sacrifice, embedded their relics into a Jiyuan ingot and launched it into Muldrasil's orbit, so it can shine as long as the star exists. There is no mention of such in existing records, and the incident may be poetic license from the author. Moreover, this is the first ever mention of the Jiyuan Ingot launch ceremony in the history of Xianzhou literature, but neither the time that this custom started nor the date of this ode's composition can be verified."

                "Desc": "Xianzhou Chordophone is a kind of traditional folk art. The name comes from the performer who has to play a chordophone while reciting along at the same time, hence, \"Xianzhou Chordophone.\" The lyrics and rapping of this style convey a vivid ambience of everyday markets, mainly using urban slang and sometimes even lacking strict rhymes. Its themes cover a wide range, from heroes of yore to passionate romance.<br><br>In my humble opinion, Xianzhou Chordophone has the highest barrier to entry for any local folk art: Not only do prospective artists need to be nimble in speech, but they also have to be excellent performers. One solo performer has to play many characters, distinguishing each to the audience by using only recitation and rap.<br><br>Not just that, but it's called \"Chordophone\" for a reason: Extreme proficiency in playing the Xianzhou chordophone is naturally a key requirement. Despite having only three strings, a Xianzhou Chordophone performer can use them to subtly evoke thousands of different moods, scenes, and emotions. I'm not talking about merely stringing along on a chordophone here.<br><br>When I was young, I heard Master Qiju's chordophone tale \"Jing Yuan's First Hunt.\" By \"young,\" I was almost 300 years old... But her superb acting and outstanding musicianship still move me deeply to this day.<br><br>Now, Master Qiju has already entered into the Hall of Karma. Some new performers have honed their craft over the centuries to also perform this masterpiece to perfection. But I truly still prefer and yearn to hear her rendition of \"Jing Yuan's First Hunt.\""

Performers strike drums while singing with the rhythm. It's almost exclusively a singing art, with almost no spoken word.<br><br>Foxian Drum Chant themes closely align with the ethnic characteristics of the foxians, who praise heroes and romance while singing of passionate battles and ardent emotion. However, compared with the simplicity of Xianzhou Chordophone, foxian drum chanters usually adopt serenely beautiful and boundlessly evocative lyrics.<br><br>But I don't think this is a contradiction. After all, one of the earliest Foxian Drum Chant songs is the foxian traditional \"Epic of Verdantia.\"<br><br>In recent years, two Foxian Drum Chants have become quite popular: The \"Cloud Knights Against the borisin\" with its depiction of historical heroes, and the soft, joyful romance of \"Foxian Bewitched.\" If you've got the time to spare, I recommend you give them a listen."

                "Desc": "Neither Xianzhou Chordophone players nor Foxian Drum Chanters really pay much attention to melody. Xianzhou locals focus on their playing of the chordophone, rather than singing, while the foxians focus on lyrics, often beating the drum along to the same melody for the whole song. The Vidyadhara locals are different: They use only a simple castanet for their instrument, relying on extremely diverse sets of melodies.<br><br>But if you're a cheery listener who doesn't particularly like to hear tales of suffering, and you see a Vidyadhara local take up their castanet to start clacking and singing... Then I humbly advise you to run for the hills! As what follows may just be unbearable for you.<br><br>It's because Vidyadhara elegies can be said to represent all of the most tragic aspects of Xianzhou culture. When singing of love, Xianzhou Chordophists sing of schoolyard crushes, foxians chant of unbridled passion, but the Vidyadhara players sing about loves lost. Similarly, the heroes of Xianzhou songs are chivalrous and courageous, the foxian heroes drive out treacherous evil, but the Vidyadhara players sing of pyrrhic victories.<br><br>Vidyadhara elegies suit a tragic tone, and they only have a handful of happy endings. Most performances leave listeners with a bitter-sweet taste. Now that I think about it, Vidyadhara elegies originate from an era of great unrest for them, and perhaps this commitment to the tragic form comes from such times of turmoil.<br><br>Several hundred years ago, there was once a Vidyadhara player named Ling Jie who sang two operas which went sensationally viral aboard the Xianzhou Luofu: \"Dragontooth Tales\" and \"Fateful Rebirth.\" \"Dragontooth Tales\" is a heroic epic with a tragic ending, while \"Fateful Rebirth\" tells of the ill-fated romance between a Xianzhou local and a Vidyadhara local that can only end in tragedy for all.<br><br>Nowadays, Ling Jie has been hatched and reborn, but her works have not been lost. Countless Xianzhou residents follow in the footsteps of Ling Jie and study these elegies, many of whom are not even Vidyadhara themselves. In this day and age, whenever you hear someone singing a Vidyadhara elegy in Xianzhou, they'll almost definitely claim to be a devoted disciple of Ling Jie.<br><br>That's why I always thought that Ling Jie's rebirth was different from other Vidyadhara players. Her culture really does live on forever in the hearts of Xianzhou residents."

But I venture to surmise that this debate is rather boring, and even more meaningless. All you need to know is that crosstalk comedy forms an extremely important part of civil life in Xianzhou, and that's enough.<br><br>As far as I know, it's by no means rare to find Xianzhou humans, foxians, Vidyadhara, and even Outworlders who care not for opera and storytelling. However, there is hardly anyone who hates crosstalk.<br><br>It's simple to see why. Crosstalk is stylish, popular, easygoing, and funny. After a long and exhausting day, sometimes you just want to relax your body and mind. That's when you find a teahouse, order a pot of hot tea, and lie back in your chair to enjoy some crosstalk — ah, now that's the life!<br><br>Crosstalk usually requires two people to perform. One performer throws out the jokes, while the other catches and builds upon them. Back and forth the conversation goes, as they talk up a hilariously witty little skit.<br><br>My humble profession might be storytelling, but crosstalk performers have much in common with us, relying on our quick tongue and wit to make a living. I spoke earlier about how a good storyteller shouldn't just talk, but rather immerse the audience in a scene — crosstalk is just the same.<br><br>What's more, crosstalk needs more than just one master performer. If your partner's found lacking, then even the greatest crosstalker of all time would turn out to be no good. There's a teamwork between two people that creates a delicate beat, and this unique narrative rhythm happens to be the magic that captures crosstalk's wit and wonder.<br><br>This is where some audiences will ask, \"In that case, isn't crosstalk more difficult than storytelling?\"<br><br>Well... I'll cast no judgment here. Why not drop into the Sleepless Earl for some storytelling and crosstalk? And then you'll be able to decide for yourself."

The Xianzhou humans, foxians, and Vidyadhara all have their own acrobatic traditions even before joining the Xianzhou. The reason is simple, too — in any time, place, and society, there'll always be marvelous buskers with talent, an interest to perform, and a need for money.<br><br>A variety of skills are used to put on dazzling acrobatics feats. Some are tough and hardcore stunts, while others are ingenious magic tricks — and the latter are often better for the show. Think about it: A Vidyadhara's performance of \"Cloudcry Magic\" takes painstaking practice, but doesn't really stupefy the crowd, as the Vidyadhara race has always known such tricks. However, a foxian's performance of \"Cloudcry Magic\" will earn a standing ovation for its astonishing wonder, because nobody can figure out how a foxian could have done it.<br><br>Therefore, when Guinaifen first debuted on the Xianzhou acrobatics scene, the audience went absolutely wild.<br><br>A traveler from beyond Xianzhou had learned so many tricks, some of which are difficult to master even for long-life species... I humbly suggest that you take the time to watch Guinaifen's performance to experience for yourself just how much incredible skill this profoundly talented acrobat has.<br><br>In my estimation, the most important aspect is that a short-life individual like Guinaifen has blasted a breath of fresh air through the stuffy world of Xianzhou folk art. Her acts include traditional stunts such as fire-breathing, sword-swallowing, bowl-balancing, umbrella-dancing, neck-pulling, and boulder-smashing — but she also invented her own uniquely creative tricks such as bullet-catching, eating noodles upside-down, whistling while brushing her teeth, and so on.<br><br>I've spent half my life on storytelling and honed my craft with words, but I still have no words to describe even one-thousandth of her supreme talents...

                "Desc": "I remember being in awe of the Xianzhou Luofu's enormity when I first saw it years ago.<br><br>The starship that we were on inched closer and closer to the \"flagship,\" until the Xianzhou's outline became visible to us passengers. That was when I heard people gasping in awe behind me. Some of them even started cheering softly. The ship was so majestic in its enormity that it projected an aesthetic aura that was strange and yet splendorous. As seasoned a traveler as I was, I found myself helplessly enamored by the sense of wonder the Xianzhou had left on me.<br><br>But just before arriving at the port, I made a startling discovery. The Xianzhou flagship might be a bit too tiny to house any civilization of note.<br><br>Throughout the vast expanse of the cosmos, there exist innumerable civilizations entirely established on artificial entities. A massive building complex formed by linking an entire star system together, a sea of artificial planets that seem to have no boundaries, a ring-shaped metropolis built around a black hole... No matter what the specific case it might be, maintaining a habitat and ecosystem — which are prerequisites for supporting any living organism — requires a genuinely enormous infrastructure to be built.<br><br>Compared with these gargantuan creations that could easily span entire galaxies, the Xianzhou flagship is simply too tiny. Some historical records from the Intelligentsia Guild have vaguely stated how the Xianzhou ship was once part of a fleet of vessels that were sent to visit Aeons. But even going by the number of all the currently remaining ships, six such Xianzhou ships would still be far from enough to provide the necessary space for any powerful interstellar civilization to survive.<br><br>However, when we finally moved into the port, went through all those labyrinthine boarding procedures with the Sky-Faring Commission, and eventually set foot on the Xianzhou Luofu, all preconceived doubts about the viability of the Xianzhou ship suddenly became comically unwarranted.<br><br>When I got to the bustling skyport that is the Luofu's Starskiff Haven, I started to question if my spatial sense had gone completely haywire. Without a doubt, all this visible space in Starskiff Haven is enough to fill up the entire Luofu. Strange planets were hanging up high in the sky. Everything looked completely different from the view on the outside. What kind of sorcery was this?<br><br>An Amicassador from the Sky-Faring Commission welcomed me with a professionally-trained smile and told me that many outworlders were just as amazed on their visit. The marvel I had just witnessed was simply referred to as \"delve\" by the locals on the Xianzhou.<br><br>In the weeks that followed, I visited several other delves on the Xianzhou ship, or should I say, the cabins of the Xianzhou. These delves all varied in size and shape, but they were all on a scale that was just too large for any normal ship to contain. Some of these delves could hold up entire commercial districts, such as Exalting Sanctum, while others could even contain vast luxuriant prairies like the Ever-Hunt Plains.<br><br>By simple logic, I knew these people here would never disclose to me the exact principles at work in these delves. If this wasn't just a visual facade, then it probably was some kind of mind-blowing space-folding technology. \"Delve.\" Hmph. They just called it a different name to make it sound more exotic.<br><br>Space folding is hardly anything new. On a large scale, it can be used for space travel, and when done on a smaller scale, it can be used as a means of storage. Many civilizations have developed their own methods of space folding. But it is still very rare to see such ubiquitous usage of space-folding technology on a scale so large that it has become a cornerstone of Xianzhou's daily life. The reason why this is particularly difficult to accomplish is surprisingly simple. The level of energy required to fold space grows in proportion to the volume of the space being folded. For most civilizations, the cost of pulling this off would just be too astronomical. But the people of Xianzhou have achieved this so effortlessly, the power behind which must have something to do with the Aeons.<br><br>By Nous, if given a chance to further examine this closely, I would perhaps be able to comprehend how Xianzhou managed to create such unusual dimensions. My discovery would definitely bring enormous economic benefits for the Intelligentsia Guild."

I've once witnessed the traffic jams of spaceships at Tannhauser's portal and the flying taxicabs in Punklorde. But it was still quite a culture shock to witness these elegant skiffs gliding past the jade-green eaves.<br><br>In the Xianzhou language, they refer to any vehicle that can fly as a \"starskiff,\" much like how we call them \"spaceships.\" However, based on the research I have conducted thus far, the term \"starskiff\" also has a more limited use case, where it specifically refers to those small passenger aircraft that have a streamlined design with a pointy end and are only for civilian usage within the Xianzhou's delves.<br><br>In the standardized months since I arrived at Xianzhou, these starskiffs have shuttled me around to different delves. The Amicassador accompanying me was a beautiful foxian girl (God knows, she might even be older than my grandmother). Then, she gave me an encouraging smile and asked if I wanted to try my hand at piloting a starskiff. \"It's fairly simple, really. Here on the Luofu, it's natural for any young person around the age of 40 to know how to pilot one.\" I rubbed my bald head and simply smiled back as I turned down her offer.<br><br>In my free time, I got to closely examine the design of these starskiffs, and I found out that their sterns were all equipped with a type of basic anti-gravity device that had the appearance of a jade piece. (The Amicassador informed me this was known as a \"jade wheel.\") It was quite intriguing that I could not spot any visible traces of the ship being pieced together. From the bottom to the deck and to the bow, the entire body of the vessel seemed to come in just one single piece. This kind of manufacturing technology piqued my curiosity, but I didn't get an answer until I got an invitation to visit the Stargazer Navalia six months later.<br><br>It was there that I got to see the starskiff assembly line. These ships weren't manufactured by some convoluted array of industrialized machinery. Rather, it was a series of petri dishes, or perhaps I should say they were more like pots for growing plants. These ships are made in a bionic assembly line that is more comparable to plant cultivation than it is to industrialized manufacturing. The ship's skeleton, hull, deck, and all other parts were all made from seeds grown in petri dishes, which were eventually made into a starskiff as one.<br><br>In terms of the advancement of space flight technology, I'm of the opinion that Interastral Peace Corporation's vessels are not inferior to these. Nevertheless, I can also see why the IPC's ships aren't more common in Xianzhou, judging from the perspective of demand and production speed."

That's the Realm-Keeping Commission's job. Doing surveys for census records? That's the Realm-Keeping Commission's job. What about maintaining order for major festivals and ceremonies, arresting thieves, and inspecting the ecosystem of the Ever-Hunt Plains? These are once again within the purview of the Realm-Keeping Commission. Finally, which department is in charge of issuing the updated star-time standard when the Xianzhou is passing through the strong gravitational pull of a celestial body? You guessed it, it's the Realm-Keeping Commission...<br><br>Outworlders interact with the Realm-Keeping Commission so frequently that there was a time when I couldn't help but wonder if these notes about the commission were superfluous. Anyone who stayed on the Xianzhou long enough would naturally become familiar with the functions of the Realm-Keeping Commission.<br><br>But when I sat down and examined the Realm-Keeping Commission in detail, I discovered that it turned out to be a highly unusual organization.<br><br>If you were to flip through some of their publicly released official materials — such as \"A Collection of Interesting Outworlder Laws,\" which every outworlder would get upon arrival, and \"Protecting Starskiff Haven,\" the commission's self-celebratory propagandist documentary, which only went viral due to its absurdity — you might think, or rather the commission wants you to think, that they are just a typical law enforcement agency.<br><br>However, when you take a closer look at what they actually do, you'll find that the scope of their work is mind-boggling.<br><br>Public security, firefighting, population statistics, calendar system... Even a fully staffed government department would be hard-pressed to take on all these duties.<br><br>Another thing that I found to be particularly unusual. The Realm-Keeping Commission is nominally in charge of handling misdemeanor cases in Xianzhou (felony cases seem to fall under the jurisdiction of the Ten-Lords Commission). But in the vast majority of misdemeanor cases, arrests are actually made by the Cloud Knights. Likewise, the Realm-Keeping Commission is the one department nominally responsible for releasing the calendar system, yet the data collection work is actually done by the Sky-Faring Commission and the data extrapolation is handled by the Divination Commission.<br><br>Based on the documents that I've sourced, the Realm-Keeping Commission presents itself to the public as a body that does odd jobs and offers support for all other departments. To put it bluntly, it functions like a sewer into which all the work flows, always working hard so that everyone else on the Xianzhou may continue their peaceful way of life...<br><br>Is that actually the case, though? Is there a group of individuals who are prepared to endure everything for the happiness of others? In my opinion, it can't possibly be this simple.<br><br>Based on my basic understanding of how human society operates, I'm of the opinion that people have in fact misconstrued the relationship between the Realm-Keeping Commission and all other departments. The Realm-Keeping Commission must have been superior to all other departments, contrary to what most people would have you believe.<br><br>Members of this commission can be found in every corner of society, from rundown ports to the ivory tower. They are the executive branch of the law, they are the hard-working scholars, and they are the scheming masterminds behind the scenes. On Xianzhou, no one can evade the watchful eye of the Realm-Keeping Commission as they are the officially licensed spies. We just can't spot them, even if they are standing right before us in plain sight.<br><br>When I start to think about all this, I can't help but feel a chill running down my spine."

And legendary tales about Xianzhou's manufacturing sector are quite widespread.<br><br>But the reality is that the Artisanship Commission's industrial assembly line is no different from all those that can be found in any other civilization. The only parts that can be described as mysterious are how incredibly slow the Xianzhou people's metabolisms are and how unusually closed off the commission is with the outside world, thus making some of their customs quite antiquated.<br><br>I remember how often I would be left scratching my head at the extreme oddities of Xianzhou customs when I first arrived. I think most outworlders who have lived on Xianzhou before know exactly what I mean. What bewildered us first were, without a doubt, those creations made by the Artisanship Commission.<br><br>All I wanted was to buy a portable lighting device that could be used as one of my disaster response gadgets. I walked by all the shelves in the store and still couldn't find what I needed. Any kind of basic flashlight would have been fine. I just wanted a small device with a design that has basically remained the same from the ancient past to our modern age, a device that you can find anywhere and that can emit light in emergencies.<br><br>I ultimately found the most \"normal\" flashlight on Xianzhou with the help of a store clerk.<br><br>The Artisanship Commission created this flashlight device in the shape of a fish, with its belly done as an open framework that could emit light. This flashlight could also produce light of adjustable intensity and emit it from different directions. As I grabbed the handle located on the fish's back, questions swirled in my mind. People on Xianzhou seemingly believed that this was a \"normal\" device for providing illumination. But this product just seemed so intricate and sophisticated to me that I would even call it a work of art... of a flashlight.<br><br>Not long after that purchase, I started to collect these \"normal\" devices that were manufactured by the Artisanship Commission. I would then send what I found to the Intelligentsia Guild for further research. Judging from the feedback I received in their reports, most of the scholars didn't quite understand this custom of making objects overly decorative.<br><br>One report in particular left the strongest impression on me. The author wrote, \"The craftsmanship of this miniature metallic beast is excellent. It is difficult to imagine how they were able to make a moving module of this precision so small. What draws my attention the most is how this device does not require any internal power source. It merely requires wind power to come to life. However, one thing still remains puzzling to me. What is the purpose of this device? Maybe it has something to do with the bell on the beast's body?\"<br><br>My poor colleague had been overwhelmed by the lavishness of the Artisanship Commission's brilliant skills. In reality, the author of the report was not far off the mark. This \"miniature metallic beast\" was indeed meant to serve as a bell. The Xianzhou people use them as doorbells or hang them in their yards as decorative pieces. That's it.<br><br>It is clear that the practice of adding ornamental features to ordinary objects (at times the decorative parts were made to a greater degree of precision than the object itself) stems from an antiquated Xianzhou tradition. To us, it seems like an eternity ago when they first left their home planet. But for them, it has been just a few generations ever since they gained immortality.<br><br>So, even if these customs from the Old Era have long lost their practical meaning, they can still serve as shared memories, passed down for generations.<br><br>The Artisanship Commission in particular values this tradition, which is apparent from their deep interest in a wide variety of ceremonies.<br><br>A ceremony would be held for the first product manufactured on a new assembly line. A ceremony would also be held for the final product of an assembly line that is being put out of commission. There is a ceremony for newly opened shops and there is one for old workshops going out of business. The Artisanship Commission perhaps may not have faith in anything other than their own technology, but that does not damper their passion for holding ceremonies.<br><br>The Artisanship Commission has a propensity to turn even the most minor objects into breathtakingly wonderful pieces of art. I am therefore convinced that it is necessary for us to research the Artisanship Commission's techniques further for potential long-term benefits."

Just countless jade abaci linked together to form a matrix.\" the former diviner replied.<br><br>\"It's nothing special, to be honest.\" This sentence has a showiness that could be considered revolting by outworlders.

Looking at the jade pendants and bracelets the people of Xianzhou wear, I can tell that their gorgeous jade jewelry is just the civilian version of jade abaci.<br><br>And based on my observations, these jade abaci that are in the form of jewelry have a powerful level of performance that is on par with any other commonly available personal computer.<br><br>I am not an expert in computer science, and so I sent some jade abaci over to a colleague in the Intelligentsia Guild who specializes in that field. Later, they sent me a response, \"Todd, all I see are some pieces of jade.

In principle, the jade abacus is a type of crystal computer.<br><br>If you were to take apart a jade abacus and do a close inspection, you would find that there are lines similar to semiconductor chips. This kind of technique is known as \"carving\" in Xianzhou. Even though we found the lines carved into the jade contained executable programs, my colleague at the Intelligentsia Guild could not find any signals being transmitted.<br><br>This is what he said:<br><br>\"I have seen many liquid-based and even gas-based computers that simply lack the structure that computers are supposed to have. But they are capable of performing powerful computations at scale because liquids and gases have a relatively flexible molecular structure, meaning they can be translocated in any way by design. I haven't discovered any similar physical properties in the structure of this jade ore. It is as if this jade was just a dumb rock that has suddenly been transformed into something heavenly by the forces of nature.\"<br><br>My colleague was more than eager to continue dissecting the jade's structure, but I had a new stroke of inspiration. Since we cannot find any components that are supplying computing power, then that must mean the jade abacus is incomplete. It needs other elements to become whole.<br><br>With this revelation, I made a wild guess (I just realized that I love using the phrase \"wild guess\")... The jade abacus itself is a certain type of quantum communication component. There was a force that existed among the tens of millions of jade abaci throughout the Xianzhou Alliance. The question is, what is supplying the computing power to all these jade abaci with?<br><br>Perhaps there are many people who don't know that mammalian brains are one of the universe's most perfect computers. Herta of the Genius Society has a powerful brain with computing abilities that are only limited by the blob of proteins between her ears. She can't advance beyond the constraints of her hardware.<br><br>But if there were a way that millions of brains could be linked together to create a complex and refined communications network like a nervous system that stretched across space, it would allow the intelligence and knowledge of those millions of people to converge together like surging rivers rushing out to sea. These millions of minds linked together would not just mean millions of minds' worth of information stored on this neural network. It would also mean that there is computing power that is at a level equal to the combined power of all these brains. A thought that once was a ripple on a lake would now be an enormous wave, every single drop of which contains hundreds of millions of synapses, releasing electronic currents and transmitting information, observations, memories, calculations...<br><br>Yes. I believe that Xianzhou utilizes jade abaci to directly link people together. They use this kind of method to observe all of Xianzhou and record every creation. They can even calculate every moment in history. Everything is clear to them. In other words, the jade abacus isn't a kind of crystal computer. Rather, it is a type of bio-quantum computer.<br><br>After my Intelligentsia Guild colleague from the computer science field heard my conjecture, he burst into laughter, like I was some kind of brainless reptile. I just hope that he can ultimately unearth the secrets of this technology... If bio-quantum computers could be applied to the Intelligentsia Guild, then this massive academic association would become a single scholar whose wisdom would be worthy of an audience with the Aeon of Erudition.<br><br>The Intelligentsia Guild has always believed that \"All knowledge must flow like currency.\" This would be the most efficient way to make that happen."

Before the trip, you kept asking me why I took on this Luofu mission at my age. Back then, I... I'm sorry, I don't remember what I told you at the time. But I know that I still owe you a sincere reply.<br><br>I know that the academy sent us here to engage in the profitable exchange of information, not to hear us ceaselessly repeat in our reports about the beautiful sights aboard the Xianzhou. But regarding the key issue of longevity, I'm like my predecessors whose only success has been managing to take in those beautiful sights.<br><br>It's been almost 12 standardized months since I came to the Luofu — so one year has passed according to the Xianzhou star calendar. I've partied at the Grand Fair in Starskiff Haven, despite the herniated disc in my back; I've drunk the cultural heritage phenomenon of mung bean soda, as recommended by Amicassadors (and when I say cultural heritage, just imagine what a hundred-year fermentation process it is — it's nothing to the Xianzhou natives!); and I've been to the Alchemy Commission for their acupuncture therapy. I feel as though I'm 20 years younger! Still good for another few whacks from the old lady's turner!<br><br>After all of these meaningless activities, I should have, as my failed predecessor should have, posed this crucial question: \"How can I, with my osteoporosis, failing memory, skin sagged like an empty beanbag... How can I return to the days of my youth, and live out another thousand years of life — just like you folks here on Xianzhou do?\"<br><br>I never asked it though, Cleo — I never said a word. And that's why I'm sitting here sipping tea and writing up all of these letters of repine.<br><br>All the intelligent beings in the universe want the secret to everlasting youth. Whilst we overwhelm ourselves with the suffering of life, we search inside ourselves and say: When our chance comes, we must take it and extend our lifespans.<br><br>Yet without the help of technology, most intelligent hominids naturally wither and fade within the span of a hundred years. Except for a few races — those human subspecies known as long-life species.<br><br>Blessed by a whimsy Aeon (usually Yaoshi), the lives of some intelligent hominids cross that threshold set for them by death. They possess a long lifespan, and multiply in disastrous quantities. What's more worrying is their natural aggression in plundering resources from various homeworlds, sometimes completely converting entire ecosystems. You must be pretty familiar with these lifeforms: The Denizens of Abundance.<br><br>These Denizens of Abundance have no small volume of literature researched about them by the Intelligentsia Guild (as far as I know, many are utterly inhumane, but of course, Abundance don't listen to reason). The researchers have all reached the same conclusion: The life-extension protocols of the Denizens of Abundance are intrinsically connected to their genetic make-up — cannibalism, interspecies blood transfusions, a hive mentality, rejuvenation via hibernation or molting... Despite easy access to longevity, most of the Denizens of Abundance lose their minds as they warp into twisted beasts (even if those saber-toothed tigers have somehow had access to interstellar travel, they would have caused less panic than the Denizens of Abundance do). Even if the Guild uncovers their secrets, nobody could commercialize it — rich people will never stump up the cost of treatment for inhuman long-living!<br><br>In the end, the Intelligentsia Guild turned their research toward a more civilized long-life species: The Xianzhou Alliance. They are mortal enemies locked in eternal combat against their fellow long-life species, the Denizens of Abundance. The Alliance seems rational, can we invest some money in learning the secret to long life from them?<br><br>Hmph, resource exchange, political mediation, trade wars... They have exhausted all possible methods to achieve nothing but regular academic exchanges. The Guild still doesn't plan on giving up, and keeps sending a stream of silly, cursed fools like us aboard the Xianzhou. Academic exchanges? Please, we might as well have the word \"SPY\" carved onto our foreheads. Do you really think the Xianzhou people don't get what we're up to? Will they just spill the beans while out doing grocery? Is it possible the masters governing the schools are all in fact idiots?<br><br>Cleo, I'm sorry about all this blathering. Maybe I'm the idiot here. I know it's an impossible task, but here I still am. Because I'm no longer the middle-aged guy who used to teach you back then — I'm old now, my joints all creak and crunch like there're caltrops inside me, and I curse the universe every time I have to rise from my chair. $?%*&! Why? Why — no matter how far our tech advances — there is still no cure for arthritis? I truly regret not taking up the company on their cyber-medical insurance policy. At the time, I was filled with hubris and thought that I'd never grow old.<br><br>But I was wrong. Now I hope to see a breakthrough before I die.<br><br>Your dearest teacher, Todd Riordan"

I have sweet talked them and poured who knows how many catties of Dragon Spring Brew into them, but I still couldn't get them to show me the medical books and pharmacopoeia that cannot be released to the public. In their words, \"This can cause you to lose your head.\"<br><br>The good news is that they were finally impressed by my \"sincerity\" and were willing to share with me some medical reports that were of little value to them. These medical reports were about the natural death of foxians.<br><br>I have attached the original report to this letter, so please pick it up for yourself.<br><br>In terms of coming to their end, the natural death of foxians, like the ultimate end of all long-life species, is shrouded in a fog that is difficult to penetrate with superficial science and technology.<br><br>During the vast majority of a foxian's life, a large number of pluripotent stem cells are stored in numerous organs of their body. These pluripotent stem cells will continuously repair the physical body of foxians, allowing aging and damage to be healed in a short period of time.<br><br>Until a few years before their end of life, the number of these pluripotent stem cells gradually decreases, but still remains sufficient to maintain their ageless appearance. At the age of 250 to 450 years (Note: The median age is 307 years), these pluripotent stem cells come to a complete halt and lose their ability to divide freely.<br><br>What ensues is a death that comes with multiple organ failure. The natural death comes quickly, with patients often dying within 3 to 4 days after the pluripotent stem cells have lost their ability to divide. The good thing is that most of them are prepared for the various age-related diseases that begin to develop in their organs, so it is typically not too late to prepare for the aftermath.<br><br>Of course, neither the Alchemy Commission nor I could figure out what factor prompts these pluripotent stem cells to suddenly fail at some point in time.<br><br>Over twenty years ago, when the Intelligentsia Guild fought the borisin, we did some related experiments. I don't know if you remember... Oh, you shouldn't remember, you weren't even that old then. At that time, we removed the livers of some of the borisin and found that they turned into a huge, aggressive \"cancerous mass\" within a few hours. Considering the phylogenetic relationship between the borisin and foxians, I think the principles involved are probably similar.<br><br>There is something else that is unexplainable: There have been many case studies where the entire liver of a foxian patient is completely removed, but there has never been a record of a foxian turning into a \"cancerous mass.\" In fact, most foxians grow a new liver after such a procedure and are discharged from the hospital with a normal recovery. (Although the records do show that losing a liver results in a much slower to regenerate compared to the loss of other organs.)<br><br>I currently believe there are two explanations for this:<br><br>1. Foxian pluripotent stem cells aren't generated at the liver, but just gather there for some reason. (Which explains why the regeneration rate becomes slower after losing the entire liver.)<br><br>2. Foxians have some kind of biological difference with the borisin, and this subtle but huge difference determines the difference between the Xianzhou natives and Abominations of Abundance.<br><br>Obviously, the incomplete \"immortality\" of foxians is not accessible to us. But I find that there is still a considerable degree of commercial value in it — while these pluripotent stem cells aren't actually \"all-powerful,\" they can still enable foxians to maintain their youthful appearance until their demise.<br><br>Cleo, before I set out, you said to me, \"Teacher Riordan, I do not want to live forever. In living so long, even the more interesting things in life become meaningless. But I'm afraid of getting old, aging is terrifying.\"<br><br>I didn't pay much heed to you at the time (and probably was even a little cold to you), but now I have to say that you were probably right. Most of the potential customers we can find in the cosmos probably hold the same thoughts as you do. They don't necessarily intend to live as long as the universe itself, but they merely wish to preserve their youth (or beauty) in the fleeting time that they have.<br><br>If you're not busy these days, do some market research for me. Maybe the foxian pluripotent stem cells will allow us to make a lot of money from \"eternal youth.\"<br><br>If I die without achieving this, then the patent is all yours.<br><br>Your dearest teacher, Todd Riordan"

Looking down, he sees a scepter in the shape of a spear-tip.<br><br>According to his own words, he has been able to safely survive his first 300 years by relying on three words alone: \"understand the situation.\" So he immediately smiles and says: \"It's urgent, right? Then I won't stop you, haha.\"<br><br>Then, he escapes in a strange pose, turning his head with an apologetic smile as he flees down the dark alleyway.<br><br>The dark-haired girl uses her scepter to lift the filthy curtain over the restroom's doorway and walks inside.<br><br>Behind the curtain, a strong stench stimulates her olfactory center. A quick analysis is completed within a nanosecond: It isn't the smell of ammonia, but a pungent odor of sodium hypochlorite. Perhaps the vast majority of law-abiding citizens of Xianzhou would never imagine an apothecary hiding out in an abandoned public restroom like this.<br><br>In the deepest part of the apothecary, a man who appears to be a physician is lost in thought. Before he can react, a young girl approaches him like a ghost. A chain, as if it had a life of its own, coils around him, binding him tightly, while the sharp tip of a staff presses against his throat.<br><br>\"Who did you tell about the secret prescriptions kept in the Elixir Research Terrace?\" The girl asks, then slightly releases the pressure so that he can speak.<br><br>\"Prescription... I don't know about any prescription... Ugh...\"<br><br>He only manages to say a few words before the girl tightens her grip, blocking up the words in his throat.<br><br>\"Who is he?\" She demands, again relaxing her right hand slightly.<br><br>\"Ahem... I don't know... Ugh...\"<br><br>\"How many of the Ten Lords' interrogation methods have you heard of? I'll ask you one last time: Who is he?\" She retracts the spear-like scepter and, in a display of strength disproportionate to her size, easily lifts him up off the ground.<br><br>\"Ahem... Coventry! Ahem... Albert Coventry! There, I said it! I told you. Please spare me!\"<br><br>The man suddenly feels all his strength has left his body. Both his legs give way as he collapses to the ground. When he comes back around and tries to see the girl's face, he realizes that the entire nightmarish interrogation process is as though it never existed — only the rustling sound from the alleyway remains.<br><br><br>Xianzhou Smartie<br><i>Posted on August 15</i><br><br>Master!

Is that what you mean?\" asked the foxian judge meekly.<br><br>\"The prescription is just a front.\" said the girl, without looking up.<br><br>\"So... as far as I am concerned, Coventry is just being used. Some people in the Elixir Research Terrace wanted to stir up chaos to muddle the news of their research.

The room was completely dark. That crazed Xianzhou hacker Mishang used to welcome him back by singing a strange ditty, but this time the room was dead silent.<br><br>\"Something is wrong,\" he quietly said to himself as he pulled out his weapon. He pushed on into the darkness.<br><br>Behind the screen that sectioned the room, a white figure emerged slowly. Coventry almost reflexively pulled the trigger of his hand crossbow.<br><br>A two-inch-long, thin, cyan-colored bolt thrummed, hovering about a foot in front of the delicate face of the young girl. The bolthead crackled with sparks as if trying to break through the invisible barrier.<br><br>\"H—How did you find me?\"<br><br>\"Cycrane.\" The response was a cold and emotionless female voice.<br><br>\"That drone? I released it as soon as I landed!\" cried the man nonchalantly.<br><br>\"The influenced cycrane has been retrieved by the Realm-Keeping Commission. Its flight path was enough for the Divination Commission to triangulate your whereabouts.\" The girl half-curiously touched the quivering bolthead in the air like teasing a butterfly.<br><br>This was the moment Coventry was waiting for, the split-second window of opportunity for his escape.<br><br>He bent his knees and pushed off with the soles of his feet. A purple electrical arc could be seen in the center of his palms. Coventry roamed many worlds and had always fluttered outside the grasp of the Interastral Peace Corporation. He was perpetually on the wanted list, not just because of his well-planned schemes, but also because he knew what to do when he was caught.<br><br>Under his artificial skin, a network of electrical pulses was implanted, Coventry rarely showed this trick up his sleeves to anyone. Whether it be the long-life species of Xianzhou or the Artisanship Commission's Ingenium creations... With a fully powered strike, they would likely all turn to ashes.<br><br>\"Electromagnetic field activate!\"<br><br>\"Gotcha!\" The man felt his enemy in his palm. If it wasn't for the need to concentrate all his attention on maintaining the electrical output, he would have laughed out loud.<br><br>Smoke rose and sparks flew as the unpleasant smell of burning filled the area.<br><br>Coventry trembled as if having an epileptic seizure as he struggled to control himself. Upon impact, the pitch-black room spun into a blob of shadow in his unimaginable defeat.<br><br>\"Your movement is too slow.\" The young girl materialized from within the shadow.<br><br>M—Movement? Coventry stared at his wrist, bent at an unnatural angle. At some point in time unbeknownst to him, that hand was forcibly pressed against his lower jaw.<br><br>\"Using electricity without being insulated. What a useless maneuver.\"<br><br>The judge in white showed no emotions on her face.<br><br>\"Involuntary Immortalization and Immortality Theft. These two are the gravest of the Ten Unpardonable Sins. Do you admit your guilt?\"<br><br>The man could not control his shaking, partially because of the electric shock, but more because of the fear.<br><br>With the remaining sanity he could muster, he begged with his coarse voice, \"Please... Please forgive me. I haven't even peeked at the prescription. I will leave it behind and get my butt off of the Luofu. Please... You will never see me again!\"<br><br>Coventry steeled his nerves, awaiting the verdict from the judge — but there was only silence in the darkness. After a long while, he seemed to hear an impossible sneering from out of the darkness.<br><br>Immediately after, that same cold voice rang out again and in a sacred, firm, and undeniable tone said word-by-word:<br><br>\"Ten Lords' Verdict.\"<br><br>Xianzhou Smartie<br><i>Posted on August 20</i><br><br>Sir!

I thought he was just like those adults who call themselves Architects, and was here to see my sister. But he was different, and didn't ignore me. He always smiles, and gives me lots and lots of candy. He also asked me some questions and I got nervous because I didn't know how to answer, but he didn't get angry. He said I was a quiet and good kid.<br><br>I started keeping a diary because of Mr. Stefan. He said that keeping a diary is a good habit for a lady to keep. He also said that keeping a diary is a very lonely affair, and that if I'm scared of being alone, I can just read aloud the diary to him.<br><br>To be honest, it's really hard to keep a diary because nothing interesting happens to me — I won't read this part to Mr. Stefan as he'll get sad, and I don't want him to be sad. I wish I were my sister, because she knows everything. She always tells me fun stories and is always telling me about the interesting people she meets.<br><br>It was only later that I realized most of my diary was about Mr. Stefan. Sometimes it's recounting our conversations, sometimes it's recording what I've learned from him, sometimes it's simply recording my mood while I wait for him to visit again.<br><br>Today, Mr. Stefan and I talked a lot, mostly trying to comfort me as I'd heard some bad news from another kid. I heard that the adults want to take my sister to some place far away, and that I might never be able to see her again. I'm scared because my sister always looks after me and protects me. If she goes, I might get hurt — and I might get even more lonely than I already am now.<br><br>Mr. Stefan told me that he wouldn't let that happen. He said, \"Cyrille is no less than her sister,\" and \"Cyrille deserves her own wonderful life.\" I know he's just saying that to comfort me, but it still feels nice to hear that from him.<br><br>Before he left, Mr. Stefan gave me a blue stone which, despite its small size, is shiny and smooth. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Mr. Stefan said this present represents our agreement — that he will take me out of here to a more spacious and comfortable place. A place without prison, a place with freedom.<br><br>I trust Mr. Stefan. He's a man of his word, unlike all the others. Today's entry is very long — longer than the whole of the previous week combined — and I'm a little tired. It's late, and I should go to bed. My sister didn't come home today, and it's just me home tonight. I'm going to sleep with the gift that Mr. Stefan gave me, so that I won't be afraid of the dark."

I beg your forgiveness, and hope that you always remember that the distance between us in space will not shake my loyalty one bit. No matter what difficulties you face, you can always turn to me for help.<br><br>I know you must be nervous right now, Cyrille, but I hope you can remember what I warned you before: Don't be intimidated by loud and empty threats. As long as you stand firm and follow my advice at all times, any pushback or complaint is just temporary white noise — something that will fade away as we draw closer to the end of the plan and ultimately become a picture painted together by us.<br><br>I sometimes still think of when I met you, more than ten years ago. You were a timid little girl back then, too shy to talk and lacking confidence in yourself. But I found something special in you — a one-of-a-kind temperament that even a genius like Cyrilla doesn't have. And it's precisely because of this unique talent of yours that I decided to stay with you, and help you build up the beautiful future that you deserve.<br><br>As for your sister, Cyrilla — unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any clues about her whereabouts. I understand how important she is to you, so I'll keep sparing no effort in my search operation. Even without the slightest progress over more than ten years, I still don't want to give up hope — and I hope you don't give up, either.<br><br>Finally, I'd like to offer my most sincere advice once more: Don't trust those opportunists in your ear telling you black is white and vice versa. They'll definitely use my absence to try and get close to you and control your mind. You have to build a solid barrier and resist their scheming noises. Remember, Cyrille — you just have to trust me.

                "Desc": "Cyrille — often called Cyrille the Fool by later generations — is the eighth Supreme Guardian of Belobog.<br><br>Cyrille was born in a remote suburb of the Belobog Overworld. Orphaned as a young girl, she lived with her sister Cyrilla who's one year older than her. Cyrille's childhood was rather uneventful; however, her sister Cyrilla was a child prodigy, displaying amazing proficiency at an early age for language, math, and logic.<br><br>Cyrilla passed the public service test when she was eleven, and was officially selected as an heir to the Supreme Guardian. However, just on the eve as the Architects were about to relocate her residence to Qlipoth Fort, she mysteriously disappeared. After days of searching without luck, most Architects wanted to give up the search and start the heir selection process anew. But the Minister of Internal Affairs, Stefan Marquez was firmly opposed, and strongly pushed for Cyrilla's sister Cyrille to take over as heir to the Supreme Guardian.<br><br>Stefan Marquez claimed that during his long-term contact with the two sisters, he'd discovered that Cyrille was as talented as her sister. Moreover, delaying the heir selection process any longer would impact Belobog's political stability due to the recency of the Supreme Guardian's untimely death. After heated internal debate, the Architects finally approved Stefan's proposal allowing Cyrille to become the new heir.<br><br>History has shown us that Cyrille's appointment was a carefully-planned hoax by the Minister of Internal Affairs, Stefan Marquez. The Architects quickly realized that Cyrille was extremely mediocre compared to her sister Cyrilla, and was clumsy in social situations. Minister Marquez's power grew stronger by the day during Cyrille's tenure, and his thugs soon retained absolute discretion throughout the Qlipoth Fort as they issued their draconian decrees. The nickname Cyrille the Fool spread throughout the people, and they grew more and more dissatisfied with this puppet Supreme Guardian and her ministerial allies.<br><br>In the 14th year of her tenure, rebels among the Architects hatched a secret plot to overthrow Stefan and his cronies. The rebels won over the Silvermane Guards' Captain and planned on luring Cyrille and Stefan to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone where they could launch a coup.<br><br>That day, the Supreme Guardian Cyrille attended the military exercise as expected, but the rebels never found any trace of Stefan Marquez. The captain played them at their own game, dispatching a fake patrol of Silvermane Guards into the restricted zone with Cyrille, and pushing her into an arsenal chest. The guards then rushed to the far north of Belobog and, under cover of darkness, shoved the unconscious Supreme Guardian in the arsenal chest over the edge of the cliff.<br><br>The rebels carried out a search operation for three days and three nights in Belobog, but never found any trace of Minister Stefan Marquez. To this day, people still attribute the death of the seventh Supreme Guardian and the disappearance of Cyrilla to Marquez's political conspiracy — a claim that, according to Belobog historians, to this day remains inconclusive and unproven."

However, there are still questions that beg to be answered.<br><br>As we know, the discipline in which you operate has defined Tottonids as \"silicon-based lifeforms that communicate with internal electrical signals.\" However, they have already become extinct through the long Amber Eras, leaving behind only a crown encrusted with a thought monotectic of past monarchs — the Curio \"Unbearable Weight.\"<br><br>Excuse my ignorance, but I have a few questions:<br><br>1. Since Tottonids allegedly communicate with electrical signals, no one in this cosmos would be able to decipher their thoughts, language, or history. So then, you can claim that said electrical signal exists, but I can also claim that said signal does not exist. How can we determine its falsifiability?<br><br>2. Since it is not falsifiable, maybe the racial history of the Tottonids was just a fabrication of the History Fictionologists since the beginning.<br><br>3. In this space station, aside from specific individuals, most researchers don't usually step out of the comfort of their labs, and therefore there had been no one who traveled to Planet Totton to verify and study this claim. Simply obtaining a crystal crown and a grand history that is, again, unverifiable had determined that the Tottonids are lifeforms with a long cultural history. Isn't this going against the criteria of research?<br><br>4. In the interdisciplinary summit in the space station, the Department of Cosmic Geography listed the mineral composition of the Unbearable Weight in a detailed report and defined it as a rare mineral cluster. However, the Department of Ecology named it a thought monotectic construct of an extinct race and claimed the Curio as their own. This, in my humble opinion, is no different than that of a pirate.<br><br>After much thought and many restless nights, I have decided that I cannot bear the thought of your good name being sullied due to misguided Curio categorization. I also could not bear the thought of my discipline being stampeded under the strong-arming ways of the Department of Ecology.<br><br>The reason for my composing of this letter and my blathering is merely so that I can convey three sentences, which are:<br><br><color=#eb4d3dff>Tottonids are f****** rocks!</color><br><color=#eb4d3dff>Tottonids are f****** rocks!</color><br><color=#eb4d3dff>Tottonids are f****** rocks!</color><br><br>A straightforward Department of Cosmic Geography Researcher"

I hate that kind of grouping cliques the most! This is no longer just for you, it's also involving my principles now!<br><br>Some Lv. 2 Researcher: No, it's not really like that. But I really ran out of ideas. If I really can't deal with it, I might be demoted to the Disposal Site.<br><br>Some Lv.4 Researcher: We're brothers, alright? If you run into problems, I will help you even if I had to make some sacrifices.<br><br>Some Lv. 2 Researcher: That's great, I knew you're different from all the other advanced researchers. It all comes down to not having enough budget to do many of the studies.<br><br>Some Lv.4 Researcher: Trust me, every researcher who worked at Herta will have faced a problem like yours. I'll be honest, many young researchers wouldn't be able to make it through this issue.<br><br>Some Lv. 4 Researcher: But you don't have to worry, because I will try my best to help you. These are my experience, hope they can help you.<br><br>Some Lv. 2 Researcher: I'm paying full attention.<br><br>Some Lv. 4 Researcher: Firstly, the most important part, we need to maintain our original intention — as a researcher, we reject the idea of forming cliques! Those who seek fame and those who seek knowledge are different to the core! The core of what we do is to distinguish ourselves from external persuasions.<br><br>Some Lv. 4 Researcher: Secondly, the funds. As the saying goes, good wine needs no bush. If you have the ability, you won't need to worry about the funds allocation. Let's look at the logic of allocating budget: The more results you contribute, the greater amount of funds you receive. So you just need to produce enough results to solve this issue!<br><br>Some Lv. 2 Researcher: That's right...<br><br>Some Lv. 4 Researcher: Finally, how to obtain results. Beginner researchers would inevitably take the path with more twists and turns, so the best way to avoid that is to join a project with an existing framework or two. I told you, I will help you to the best of my abilities. It just so happens that I have a major project that passed the review board.<br><br>Some Lv. 4 Researcher: If it succeeds, funds would be the least of your problems. However, there's another group of fame-seekers who are trying to rob me of the core researcher title. I don't care about the title, naturally, but I didn't expect the results of the selection would have an impact on the progress of the project...<br><br>Some Lv. 4 Researcher: I'm already behind on the core researcher voting selection, but if we put in some effort to vote, I might still have a chance!<br><br>Some Lv. 4 Researcher: I'll send you a link, it'll automatically recognize your researcher ID so you don't have to log in manually.<br><br>Some Lv. 4 Researcher: Are you still there?<br><br>Some Lv. 4 Researcher: ...<br><br>Some Lv. 4 Researcher: (1 missed call)"

This study will attempt to explore that with reconstructed Tottonid Crystal samples.<br><br>The researcher placed three individual crystals into three vacuum containers to ensure the crystals will not be able to receive transmissions from each other through physical contact. Then Subject #1 was connected to an electronic transducer before a preset message was input. The message includes five information points, of which four are genuine imperial history of the Tottonids, and one is a rumor regarding the empire.<br><br>After the transmission process is over, the researcher placed the three crystals in identical environments and observed the electrical signals of the crystals in real time for 24 hours. Data shows that Subject #1 first shared a piece of genuine history of the Tottonid monarchs, to which Subjects #2 and #3 responded positively. Then, Subject #1 shared the piece of rumor about the Tottonid Empire, and autonomously added details that the researchers did not input, causing the internal electrical signals in Subjects #2 and #3 to fluctuate extremely. However, the three crystals quickly synchronized, exhibiting a high degree of resonance. The following are some examples of the messages between the crystals during the observation:<br><br><i>#1: Do you know Messphink?</i><br><i>#2: No, who's that?</i><br><i>#1: It's only a rumor, but I heard this Messphink is the offspring of Tottonid III...</i><br><i>#3: Isn't Tottonid III's offspring Rosevank? They're famous for their wisdom!</i><br><i>#1: That's why I said it's a rumor! Rosevank is the one above the table, and Messphink is an illegitimate one!</i><br><i>#3: Wha!? No way! If it were real, there's no way Rosevank didn't find out, right?</i><br><i>#2: Maybe Rosevank did find out, they just didn't expose this...</i><br><i>#1: You know, maybe Messphink is not only Tottonid III's offspring, but also Rosevank's...</i><br>(Author's Note: The preset messages did not include this detail. It was added on by Subject #1 without prompting)<br><i>#3: Oh my word, this is ridiculous! But it does sound like something the imperial family would do...</i><br><br>To summarize, the researchers believe that the Tottonid crystals also experience differences between subjective perception and objective awareness during communication between individuals, and that the difference is most likely similar to that of carbon-based organisms. Further in-depth studies are requested to be approved.<br><br><i>Supervisor's Comment: My dear, I do not wish to deny this study's value and logicality. I believe that you are an outstanding researcher. However, there is an error with the transcoding of your Tottonid Crystal samples — One of the researchers accidentally included their own transcoded brain waves during the output. This report is not completely useless, however. At least we now know that there is a need to pay attention to media literacy in the space station.</i>"

That is why the various victims of the Dark-Blue Scam have come together to form the Dark-Blue Scam Victim Association. We have produced this guide and collected the usual lies and classic cases of such scams. All citizens, please read this carefully and remember it well to protect our sacred private properties from being ravaged!<br><br>Parallel Universe<br><br>The most common concept that the scammers try to sell. There are already 73 types of sub-scams reported to the city, including, but not limited to, Parallel Universe Printers, Parallel Universe Containers, Parallel Universe Ingredient Bags, Parallel Universe Remote Controls, and many other items used in daily life. The scammers often customize the pitch and are very hard to detect!<br><br>Please also be careful when purchasing items related to parallel universes in second-hand shops. It is best if you immediately report the incident to the Silvermane Guards and record any monetary losses. Please avoid going alone to confront the scammers. Stop your investment on time and prevent chain scamming. The guide warns all Belobog citizens that no shield grows out of the snow. Wealth must be gained with your own industrial two hands!<br><br>Perpetual Machine<br><br>A scamming case study provided by a victim, Molly. The scammer used a pre-set mechanism to construct a seemingly never-stopping gear wheel, but the victim realized once she was home that it needed to be manually winded up. According to more recent victim reports, there are now sub-scams such as the Water Spinning Wheel, Four Pendulum Clock, and Circling Wheel. The guide warns all engineers and technical staff to firmly remember the basic laws of the objective world and not to superstitiously believe in fantasies. Do not go after big personal achievements and fall into the trap of the scammer.<br><br>The Omnipotent Key<br><br>A scam case study provided by a victim, Nick. The scammer used modeling clay and precision key mold to demonstrate to the victim how to replicate the key for various mechanical cogwheel locks, and encouraged the victim to conduct activities that would hurt Belobog's financial security. Nick was caught in the act by the Silvermane Guards when he was replicating keys outside of the south gate of the Belobog Chamber of Commerce, and is now jailed in the Third Belobog Prison. The guide would like to warn all citizens not to lose your future due to a moment of greed.<br><br>Android Puppets<br><br>A scam case study provided by a victim, Manya. The scammer used a wooden puppet and \"android face mask\" to make a substitute puppet according to the victim's specification. However, the drive installed had too much energy reserve and the puppet did many things that did not fit with the victim's normal behavior, such as working overtime at the Town Hall till dawn. The victim indicated that she suffered great humiliation and her intrinsic motivation toward life was shattered. The guide would like to remind all citizens to achieve a good work-life balance, and not to go down a path where you can be manipulated by scammers.<br><br>Intracranial Theater<br><br>A scam case study provided by a victim, Vaska. The scammer used two mini \"In-ear Music Boxes\" to store the audiobook of the <i>Tale of the Winterlands</i> as the victim had requested. However, according to the victim, the latter half of the recording was edited and recited by the scammer, with the entire cast dying and dealing indelible emotional damage to the victim. The guide would like to remind all citizens to embrace reality and do not lose yourself in dreams of virtual worlds, and definitely do not imagine yourself living in such stories.<br><br>The other detailed cases are all collected in the <i>Dark-Blue Scam Case Pamphlet</i>.

News of victory from the Snow Plains war front outside of the forts reached us by dawn of the Solwarm Festival. The city of Belobog is jubilant and cheers can be heard throughout the day. It has been more than a score of years since the cruel and cunning aliens invaded, and the Solwarm Festival celebrations are held every year through the war to maintain morale. The celebration this year must be the most elated in more than twenty years.<br><br>The Supreme Guardian Alisa Rand gave a personal command before the Solwarm Festival that all Silvermane Guards would march outside and take formation on the Snow Plains, combating the main forces of the alien army. Rhonda Landau, the hero of our army, protected the gate together with the Amber and Torch Brigades. They fought for four days and nights in the blizzard, never retreating even one step.<br><br>For the first four days of the battle, the fighting was severe and our army had suffered from not having the main troops on site. However, the enemy's relentless assault never shook our morale, and we continued to defend the pass. On the next day, Jaeger firmly carried out the battle plans previously set out by the Supreme Guardian and formed a vanguard division with the guerrilla fighters, launching a surprise attack on the enemy's right flank and creating an important opening for us. The Supreme Guardian Alisa Rand also attacked behind enemy lines with the Royal Guard and surrounded the enemy. On the dawn of the Solwarm Festival, our armies successfully joined up and formally launched our counter attack.<br><br>The Supreme Guardian Alisa Rand took to the front lines herself, spear in hand as she led the troops onward. Flames torched the sky everywhere she went. The amber tip of her spear stirred up the very blizzard, and it roared and boomed like thunder from the heavens. According to the Royal Guard members who survived the battlefield, the giant lance of the Supreme Guardian could even tear open the clouds and temporarily show the blue sky that we had not seen for decades. Other soldiers returning from the battlefield said they could feel an unstoppable force with them as they fought alongside Alisa Rand. Under the protection of such majestic powers, the soldiers could even block the enemy's blade strikes with their bare hands and suffer no injuries as a result.<br><br>The Silvermane Guards attacked with all their might and fought until dawn yesterday and finished off all the enemies. The remains of the enemy forces fled northward over the Snow Plains, and the Supreme Guardian sent troops after them in pursuit.<br><br>This engagement was an unprecedented battle at the Snow Plains, as well as an unprecedented victory. After this battle, the remaining troops of the aliens were on the brink of utter defeat. Belobog will certainly remain standing in the blizzard, and walk towards total victory with her people in the war of preservation!<br><br>Silvermane Guards Review Comments:<br>No objections, but it would be better to remove my battalion number.<br><br>Supreme Guardian Review Comments:<br>Publication permitted."

An additional 178 soldiers were assigned to reserve squads away from the front lines due to various degrees of injury and have been sent to the field hospital in the restricted zone for treatment, unable to return to the front lines in the near future.<br><br>As of now, both the Direwolf Battalion and the Snowmole Battalion under the Amber Brigade are unable to maintain formations. The relevant units have been re-organized as follows: The Snowmole Battalion has been dissolved and all former Snowmole Battalion members have been absorbed into the Direwolf Battalion. The former lieutenant colonel of the Snowmole Battalion had voluntarily resigned from their position and now acts as the logistics manager of the Direwolf Battalion. The Direwolf Battalion will retain its current designation and remain within the Amber Brigade.<br><br>Due to the aforementioned reasons, our defense lines now have insufficient troops in the northeast and need reinforcements. As we do not have enough human soldiers at the present, I recommend each battalion of the automaton brigade to send over some units to compensate for this lack of fighters.<br><br>Moreover, the morale of our troops has slipped significantly due to continuous losses and severe injury. Multiple battalions have voiced their displeasure — Not towards you as the captain, but towards Supreme Guardian Cocolia.<br><br>Looking back over the previous engagements, it is evident that we only suffered severe losses whenever the Supreme Guardian overstepped her role and gave out direct commands. With all due respect, I understand that the Supreme Guardian is desirous of victory, but we must never leave our defensive lines and directly engage with the Fragmentum creatures. Not only does this go against the calculated outcomes of the Ovtchaporov Dynamic Combat Formula, it is also a denial to the army's years of combat experience.<br><br>In order to quell the complaints within the army, reduce our losses, and preserve our strength as much as possible, please negotiate with the Supreme Guardian and reclaim the command of the Silvermane Guards. <s>At the very minimum, please don't let her issue ludicrous commands such as \"Silvermane Gunners, move forward by 20 meters.\"</s><br><br>Pelageya Sergeyevna"

Foreword<br><br>The management and inspection of starskiffs in the Xianzhou Luofu are usually the direct responsibility of the Sky-Faring Commission's Department of Aviation. The Department of Aviation will conduct random safety inspections on docked starskiffs according to relevant legislations, such as the <i>Starskiff Safety Inspection Regulation</i> and the <i>Regulation on Official Techniques for Starskiff Inspection</i>. Annual inspections are arranged for starskiffs at the location where they are registered. This is to maintain the Xianzhou's starskiff sailing routes and normal operation of equipment, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the interstellar citizens of the Xianzhou.<br><br>2. An Overview on Safety Inspections<br><br>The Commission will determine the extent of the inspection based on the starskiff's annual maritime report when organizing a starskiff safety inspection. If the annual report and registration details are missing, then the Sky-Faring Commission will dispatch a safety squad to determine the appropriate standards according to the starskiff's type, size, tonnage, and energy efficiency. A specific safety inspection plan will then be set.<br><br>Any starskiffs that pass the safety inspection will be immediately issued with the <i>Sky-Faring Commission Regulated Inspection Report</i>, and the outcome of the inspection will be recorded in the dynamic starskiff monitoring system.<br><br>3. Steps of the Safety Inspection<br><br>1) Persons responsible for incoming starskiffs, please first log into the Xianzhou dynamic starskiff monitoring system. The system will compare the information against the registration details of the starskiff to verify whether the vessel had passed the Commission's annual inspection. If you are transporting or in possession of any items that are prohibited or undocumented in the <i>Xianzhou Interstellar Trade Regulations</i>, please report them voluntarily to the monitoring system.<br><br>2) Please open your Personal Page in the dynamic starskiff monitoring system and click on \"Recent Registrations\" to find the starskiff you are currently steering. If you see the words \"Inspection Passed,\" you may skip to the Route Planning function in the Safety Inspection menu and proceed to the docks according to the navigated route and voice prompts, register the vessel, and obtain the starskiff temporary pass.<br><br>3) If you see the words \"Verify at Dock\" under Recent Registrations after selecting your current starskiff, proceed to Border Control according to the navigated route and voice prompts to wait for verification by the system. Once you have passed verification, you will be issued with a Xianzhou Luofu temporary pass per standard workflow.<br><br>4) If you see the words \"Physical Inspection\" under Recent Registrations after selecting your current starskiff, please stop the vessel immediately. Please prepare relevant documents such as Crew Adjustment Certificates and wait for the Security Department from the Sky-Faring Commission to board the vessel to conduct the inspection.<br><br>5) If items that are prohibited or undocumented in the <i>Xianzhou Interstellar Trade Regulations</i> are found during the physical inspection, the goods will be temporarily confiscated by Cloudford Border Control. The vessel will be fined or prohibited from sailing in accordance with the type of goods confiscated. If the vessel repeats the offense and trades outside of the regulations again within three calendar months, the Sky-Faring Commission's dynamic starskiff monitoring system will permanently remove you from the register.<br><br>6) If your vessel is discovered to contain illegal personal modifications such as cabin alterations, expansions, and connections between different rooms during the physical inspection, or if your vessel does not meet the required fire safety and general safety standards (such as outdated aerosol sprays and oxygen insulation bags), we will issue a specific list of issues and required rectifications. Please voluntarily rectify the identified issues according to the list. Should your vessel be found to contain safety breaches again the next time you dock, the Sky-Faring Commission's dynamic starskiff monitoring system will permanently remove you from the register.<br><br>7) After passing dock registration, please undergo Cloudford's full-body check with your entire crew, bringing with you appropriate identification documents and your temporary pass. For details of the check, please wait for notifications from the Sky-Faring Commission staff after arriving at the docks or consult documentations within the dynamic starskiff monitoring system."

It was the height of autumn and Master Gao Tang had set up the Ninefold Peace set menu to serve food made from fresh seasonal produce, with uniquely crafted dishes, and tastes rivaling the creation of the God of Stove itself. It was a pleasant meal where time seemed to fly, and the impression was so strong that I had to compose this review for my fellow gourmets as a reference. In my opinion, the menu is the epitome of culinary arts and deserves a special visit.<br><br>Appetizer — Glazed Boat<br>The first appetizer was already a marvel. Master Gao Tang lightly roasted fresh crab shells and etched patterns resembling the texture of wood grains onto them. Then he used a chisel to carve the shells into the shape of small boats, making them so thin that they were almost translucent. The crab claw meat was mixed with sturgeon gill gelatin and formed into meatballs, which were boiled in stock then placed within the boat. The meatballs were elastic and shivered as if they were alive when the plate was moved. For the meat ball filling, mature crab roe was velveted with alcohol and stirred until it turned into thick mush, which was injected into the meatballs with a bamboo syringe. That was when it became clear to me why fish gelatin was mixed into the meatballs! The elastic meatballs expanded after being filled with crab roe. Their skins were transparent and the golden liquid within could be clearly seen, as if they were priceless jewels and precious stones.<br><br>First Course — Drunk Crimson Creek<br>Live Lucky Prawns were placed onto a platter carved into the form of natural scenery, with Apricot Blossom Reserve poured into the bowl to inebriate the prawns before slowly boiling the ensemble over warm rocks. The drunk Lucky Prawns would stretch open their claws and feet! This marvel is hard to reproduce even for the Xianzhou. The slightly shivering live prawns fully absorbed the rich aroma of the Apricot Blossom Reserve and needed to be consumed with a sauce. According to Master Gao Tang, this sauce was made specifically from the prawn queens rarely found amidst the schools of Lucky Prawns. These prawn queens were simmered into an unctuous texture, then mixed with the petals of Trepidation Flowers and the buds of Utterance Grass. The taste shook me to the very core of my being, as if it was a glimpse from the Reignbow Arbiter!<br><br>Main Course — Brook Tumbling Over Rocks<br>The Garden of Gourmet elevated the common Xianzhou dish \"Three Rocky Delicacies\" to a new height. It was made with the sirloin of the fattiest seasonal Yellow Boulder Beef from this autumn, whose patterning resembles jade ores, and braised on a low simmer in a secret mixture of spices and stock. I inquired after the list of spices used multiple times, but the master only replied with a stern face: \"You will be unable to understand the essence of the dish even if you have the recipe, so why should I bother?\" Hmph, what excessive pride. The beef was then placed into another braiser where it was cooked until gelatinous fat coalesced and the aroma of the meat could be smelled. Once plated, a teapot of stock was poured over the beef, which now resembled black rocks, and the Firework Flowers were used as decoration, as they bloom briefly upon contact with heat. The entire dish was presented as a dark mountain of jade with liquid flowing down and Firework Flowers blooming below, a decadent feast for the eyes — and the stomach.<br><br>Dessert — Fallen From the Skies<br>The dessert was also unique. Crescent bownana from the Ever-Hunt Plains were simmered into a sauce, into which were placed solid pieces of rare goat milk cream mixed with honey. After that, two purple taros were diced into small pieces in the shape of stars, which were hollowed out with delicate tools. The bownana sauce was injected into the taro pieces via a bamboo syringe as before. Master Gao Tang's knife work was smooth and decisive and the process was fun and mesmerizing. I watched as he placed the taro pieces into ice to cool, then immediately turned the heat to high on a separate pot to boil royal jelly. When bubbles started to emerge, he immediately poured the taro pieces in and steam instantly rose up and rolled out of the pot. He then poured the mixture into the plate before it completely cooled, making it solidify into the shape of a waterfall midair. The outside of the pieces was golden and crunchy, while the royal jelly mixture was sweet without being overwhelming."

I recall that I had a minor disagreement with him and we both vowed to never speak again, yet I instantly let go of all our past grievances when I heard him call out for me in the Sleepless Earl... Little did I imagine that we would sit at the same table and drink tea together again after a few centuries.<br><br>It seems the Sleepless Earl is just the kind of place where you always have surprise encounters.<br><br>We drank pot after pot of Whale-Tide Spring and called for more hot water. As the tea thinned in its aroma, the daylight started to dim. My friend was assigned to manage ships and equipment in the Cloud Knights and must return to his post according to regulations, and we parted ways unwillingly after exchanging contact details.<br><br>As I walked below the lanterns on the way home, I recalled the many memories I shared with my friend. I remembered that I passed the flying test when we were learning how to fly ships at the Sky-Soaring Seas, but my friend didn't. I remembered we did part-time jobs at All Under One Roof for a long time just to get enough money to buy the latest Halcyon jade abacus... We were once the closest of friends, yet we didn't talk for centuries because of some disagreement I can't even remember.<br><br>If my friend and I were not living in the Xianzhou, we might have passed away before we even hit a hundred years old and would have never met again. That would be far too unfortunate.<br><br>Maybe I drank too much tea and was too excited — I couldn't sleep even though I laid in bed for a long time, and I decided to take an evening walk. The moon in the delve today was clearer than that of days before and would be a pity to miss. It would be best enjoyed with someone else. Luckily, my student was also awake, and I brought him to take an evening walk with me.<br><br>Past the Court of Tranquility and deep in the grass was the ruin of a garden complex built in the old style. It was hidden deep in the grass and yet to be cleaned out. The masonry reflected a gentle white light under the caresses of the moon. A pseudo-ancient stone lion was lying sideways on the grass, napping sweetly in the open as if it was slowly sinking into a pond of moonlight... My student and I held our breath, terrified of possibly waking it.<br><br>The other ruins here included stone pillars with lotus capitals and water basins etched with cloud patterns. Unfortunately, there was no complete garden left anymore. Young artists want to revive the old style as \"fashion\" and build old things every once in a while. I believe they, just like me, are terrified of the endless expanse of time. They always want to remember the past more intensely to prevent the bygone days from being diluted, but all this effort will prove to be futile before time.<br><br>The mossy masonry deep in the grass seemed to be breathing. A distant voice was saying: \"Don't try to understand it. For tonight, you need only to feel.\" I, therefore, stopped thinking too much. During that time, my student had already fallen asleep on his feet.<br><br>Pedestrians passed the Verdurous Garden every day in the company of moonlight and broken rocks, only this time we have folks of leisure such as my student and I."

Here Are the Three Unmissable Moments in the Show<br>Author: Olsen, Journalist of <i>Belobog Weekly</i><br><br>With a dazzling cast never before seen, the Golden Theater recently drew up the curtains for the powerful thirty-year commemorative performance for <i>Beneath the White Cloak</i>! Apparently, the number of citizens queuing up for tickets had repeatedly blocked key roads in the Administrative District, ultimately getting the Silvermane Guards to come out to maintain order.<br><br>The suspense musical <i>Beneath the White Cloak</i>, famous throughout Belobog, is the longest running show in the history of the Golden Theater. As we anticipate the thirty-year commemorative performance, we review the three unmissable famous scenes in the history of this show.<br><br>1. The mysterious white silk and crystal petals that fall from box number five<br>When the Lady in White first appears, a very mysterious and delicate white silk will fall from on top of box number five. Hand-made crystal petals will also fall with the silk. In previous and popular versions of the show, the silk usually falls at a speed of 2.5 meters per second. The hand-made flower petals are specifically dyed to reflect marvelous colors under the light. Importantly, out of all the official merchandise sold in the theater for <i>Beneath the White Cloak</i>, the crystal petals are the most popular — The cast also do not prohibit the audience from taking the petals with them. For over thirty years, this had been the unspoken agreement between the audience and the production cast. In fact, the thirty-year commemorative production had declared they had more than six thousand crystal petals prepared for every performance.<br><br>2. Count David's Proposal: The Omnipresent Lady in White<br>When Count David publicly proposes to Lareina, the most fascinating part is not the seemingly romantic love story between the lead characters, but the unpredictable re-appearance of the Lady in White. In the initial version of the performance, the Lady in White suddenly appeared in the audience. As the Golden Theater became more technically advanced, the Lady in White's re-appearance became more mysterious and epic. She could walk out from the reflections of countless mirrors on the stage, and could also rise slowly from beneath the floor boards under the candelabra in the middle of the audience after a loud bang and copious amounts of fog. The technical department of the Theater designed a set that can only be moved with twenty people in order to create the mystery of the Lady in White. This had satisfied the audience for the past decade, and also gave rise to a minigame popular amongst theater-goers — can YOU guess where the Lady in White is going to appear during a particular performance?<br><br>3. An all-star finale sang by established and upcoming actors<br>The final chorus is the closing act for all actors in the theater within the show. The protagonist Lareina is only an upcoming character, while Rebecca stands in the audience and they gaze at each other. In the story, the protagonist silently leaves the stage as the leading actors sing together. However, <i>Beneath the White Cloak</i> had influenced generations of musical talent in the past thirty years. At the end of the story, the final song \"Sleepless Night\" was just meant to be a collective performance, but the wide appeal of the show gradually became the collective memory of generations. Nowadays, the \"temporary actors\" appearing on stage at the final song are usually very established actors, or even past leads in older renditions of <i>Beneath the White Cloak</i>. Various famous actors in the musical scene would also make sudden appearances in this ending show. For the audience, this is an absolutely must-see moment, a sparkling scene that will get you your money's worth — who can say no to the joy of trying to count how many famous actors are on the stage at the end?"

The director of this play is Martin, the Silver-Haired Martin famous for directing <i>The Belobog Wedding</i> and <i>Gone Guest</i>. As a five-times winner of the Goliards Award for Best Direction in a Play, he chose a brand-new genre to direct this time — the fantasy genre.<br><br>Director Martin took the time to have an interview with us on the media premiere night for <i>Roadside Picnic</i>. \"I used to direct romance and intrigue stories, but those stories won't satisfy my ambitions anymore.\" Martin has a detailed plan for his future career. His latest work, the fantasy play <i>Roadside Picnic</i>, is twice as long as his prior works, giving him more than enough space to showcase his skills.<br><br>Martin has his unique aesthetics in selecting stories. In the past, his award-winning works were all adapted from real-life events. However, his latest work, <i>Roadside Picnic</i>, is a completely imagined story. He is also no longer choosing playwrights with a background in media and journalism. Surprisingly, the playwright for <i>Roadside Picnic</i> is a \"newcomer\" who is writing for the stage for the first time — Marjorie, the literary master famous throughout Belobog.<br><br>It is no coincidence that this literary master wrote the play — Marjorie is known for authoring sharp and bizarre stories, and Martin had always thought her stories are well-suited for the stage. However, Marjorie was initially busy finding materials for her new book and had refused Martin's first few invitations. With the help of Louise, the show's producer, director Martin finally moved Marjorie with his well-prepared concept design documents. Marjorie voluntarily delayed plans for her new book and left some free time specifically for this theater project.<br><br>Although the show seems like a fantasy story fit for the whole family, the amount of twists it contains far exceed the audience's expectations due to the cross-disciplinary collaboration between two masters. On the surface, this is a story between the mole kingdoms and a human family. However, the show is very fast-paced and a large amount of detail is hidden on the stage. If the audience loses track of the pacing for even a moment, it becomes hard to grasp the mysteries and answers hidden in the stage backdrop, the spoken lines, and even in the lighting design.<br><br>The plot of <i>Roadside Picnic</i> brings endless thinking for adults and acts as a brain-twister for children. The Belobog citizens hail this play as a \"Brain-Twister Masterpiece.\" The wise could extrapolate from the details and absorb the implications behind every little reference, while the innocent delight in the endless creativity behind the story. \"This story offers a brand-new view for us to examine our own lives.\" That was how Martin, the show's director and five-time winner of the Goliards Awards for Best Direction in a Play, replied to these praises and comments.<br><br>Faced with eager journalists on the media night, Silver-Haired Martin only gave out a small amount of useful information. These vague snippets can only be completely understood after viewing <i>Roadside Picnic</i> in its entirety. All this is one big surprise that Martin and Marjorie had prepared for us this year."

On April 8, the musical <i>Leisha and Mrs. Trude</i> adopted from the classical fairytale will re-open at the Golden Theater.<br><br>The special charm of musicals made every corner of the theater fill with supernatural fairy tale beauty the moment <i>Leisha and Mrs. Trude</i> started. The traditional sing-and-dance format of musicals were broken in this two-hour music extravaganza. To suit the tastes of younger audiences, the performers stood on stilts and had puppet shows. These adjustments were very effective — in <i>Belobog Weekly</i>'s annual Best Musical Award this year, <i>Leisha and Mrs. Trude</i> won the Young Adult's Choice by a wide margin.<br><br>\"This is a unique experience merging stories together with reality. I have three children and they're not all around the same age. The oldest is fourteen and the youngest is only six, but they all think this show was amazing.

Kyle, the show's director, told us that the musical contains many magnificent and creative backdrops and sets that are inspired by the children's story.

During the media preview event last night, <i>Once Upon a Snowsieged Country</i> stirred up hot discussion amongst the Belobog media with its star-studded cast and their outstanding performance.<br><br>Sara, Goliards Awards recipient and six-time nominee for Best Female Opera Singer, a heavyweight in the opera scene and a very respected senior, was long used to drama and grand occasions in this profession. And yet, she shed rare tears when she spoke about <i>Once Upon a Snowsieged Country</i>.<br><br>\"I didn't want to accept the role for Alisa Rand. I thought my body hadn't fully recovered, and my resonance at the high notes were not as clear as before. But Carola told me this was her final work before she says goodbye to opera. So, after some thought, I decided to bear with it and take this role.\" Sara explained to us the twists and turns behind her journey to the role of Supreme Guardian Alisa Rand in <i>Once Upon a Snowsieged Country</i>.<br><br>From more than ten years ago, the legendary female opera conductor Carola was already collaborating with Sara, who had just entered the operatic stage at that time. Sara had stopped her literature studies at the University of Belobog to chase her dreams of music. However, Carola was already a legendary conductor famous throughout Belobog. Not only was there a large age gap between her and Sara, they were also very different in recognition and career stage. How did they become such bosom friends?<br><br>\"I was very young, and like many young people, I had a big appetite but a thin wallet. My friendship with Carola started with food.\" This soprano, who is now a new legend, spoke of how she met Carola. They met at a charity gala hosted by a theater. Sara was just focused on eating, and Carola also held a plate. They then met in front of the same dish. More than a decade later, the two ladies with similar culinary tastes have already been friends for many years.<br><br>Unfortunately, Carola had decided to retire due to her advancing age, and she chose <i>Once Upon a Snowsieged Country</i> as her farewell piece. Sara told us that Carola was not the only one who joined the <i>Once Upon a Snowsieged Country</i> cast because of a stubborn dream. The director Figaro wanted to challenge himself with a serious drama focused on a group of people, making a perfect start to his career transition. Meanwhile, for established operatic legends such as Sara, Carola, and the composer Andrew, they wanted to innovate and create a new road for the field of opera.<br><br>\"If you've read the program or the fliers for <i>Once Upon a Snowsieged Country</i>, you'd know that it is actually a story about a group of people, even though I was listed as lead female.\" Sara explained. <i>Once Upon a Snowsieged Country</i> chose six legendary Supreme Guardians in the history of Belobog, and recounted their illustrious lives to their successor in the story. Apart from Sara playing Alisa Rand, over half of the characters are played by new actors. Sara and her peers, the \"Walking Opera Legends,\" want to help young people to make a name in this industry by putting more established performers with newcomers. This was how Sara and Carola got to know each other years before. As Carola is about to leave the stage, Sara wants to continue the story between her and her friend in some way or other.<br><br>\"To love, that wants nothing in return. To dreams, that won't allow us to turn back. And, to the future of opera.\" Smiling, Sara lifted a glass of water to us. Using water instead of alcohol, she offered her sincerest wishes to the future of opera."

Your steaming hot tea had accompanied me through nights when inspiration ran dry.<br>For Old Goethe, Tony, and Kerry.<br><br><i>\"I lit up all the fireplaces in the hotel. On the next day, the entire city was covered in fog.\"</i><br><br>One<br>Goethe left on a summer night. The stars glittered like water, but snow fell from the sky. He had told Lesley that he might still have unfulfilled wishes. She knew what it was, but she couldn't manage it.<br><br>Lesley remembered that the first time she saw Goethe was at the Goethe Hotel. The well-dressed gentleman looked at her with a smile, and she saw her own reflection clearly in the caramel depths of his eyes. However, she was disheveled from her escape and was not presentable. Lesley hurriedly shifted her eyes away but the gentleman with the chiseled features did not despise her, instead offering her a cup of hot tea.<br><br>\"Beautiful lady, how can I be of assistance?\" That was the first sentence Goethe said to Lesley.<br><br>Two<br>Goethe Hotel was indeed as the rumors said, a shelter in this world full of strife. A kind older man with a bad leg had told Lesley as she escaped here from the mines: \"Goethe Hotel is the only shelter in the entire road, because the rules here are a lot more different from everywhere else.\"<br><br>And that was indeed true. Everyone in the hotel knows that while Mr Goethe appears kind, he was very famous when he was young. No matter who you are, everyone has to respect the boss and do not cause a fight in the hotel. Even though this was not a rule written out and displayed on the hotel walls, it was a hard rule obeyed by all in this border town for the past decade or so.<br><br>\"Mr Goethe is an honorable man.\" People in the know found it hard to stop praising the owner of the hotel. Mr Goethe, the manager of this luxury hotel, always seemed very kind. Nobody knew where his funds came from, but everyone knew he actually charged very little with guests who are in need. For years, he had silently sheltered the poor with nowhere to go.<br>People like Lesley.<br><br>Three<br>Lesley was originally working at a place famous for its mining industry. There were mines everywhere, and nobody knew just how many veins were still undiscovered. There were always rumors about someone discovering a vein and becoming rich overnight. Lesley had heard her work colleagues say that the owner of their mine was one such lucky soul. Thanks to the support of the various mines, the city also offered plenty of job opportunities. Lesley worked there for a few years and managed to save up some money. She sent the money home, only to receive the terrible news of her mother's death from illness a few days later.<br><br>Lesley couldn't understand how her mother could suddenly become so ill. She was even more confused with how she was hunted down by a tough-looking thug when she was heading home. It was so strange. The home she grew up in, the home that sheltered her, the home that gave her so many memories — it was suddenly a forbidden place. Lesley had wanted to offer a bouquet of flowers loved by her mother at her grave, but now she couldn't even get home.<br><br>The only thing that welcomed her home was the blizzard.<br><br><i>*The following pages seem to have been forcibly torn off.

We had spent the most peaceful half-century since the founding of Belobog after the great woman's passing. The people live in prosperity, and the city is moving in the right direction. We are at the best time in our history. All this was because of the work the Supreme Guardian put in while she was alive. Today, I ask us to please offer our most sincere thanks to Madam Alexandra.<br><br>During Madam Alexandra's tenure, Belobog underwent dramatic transformations. The extent of development for the Underworld accelerated, and countless spirited young people made their name in the mining towns. While she put great effort in developing the society and economy of the Underworld, Madam Alexandra also devoted herself to developing education. She supported and created the University of Belobog for scientific research. With her generosity, the scientific understanding of underground ecology also reached new heights. Moreover, Madam Alexandra also unified the units of measurements in Belobog, and established the After-Fortification Calendar, which is still in use. It is fair to say that, were it not for Madam Alexandra, Belobog would perhaps still be living in the equivalent of a chaotic and ignorant night.<br><br>Personally, Supreme Guardian Alexandra was a hero I had never met. When I was still a candidate for the Supreme Guardian, Madam Fainka often spoke to me about grandma Alexandra. It could be said that she had seemingly never left us, and is still with us today. Belobog will forever remember Alexandra and every Supreme Guardian before and after her. We will not forget these great names even after fifty — No, we will remember even after a hundred, five hundred, or a thousand more years.<br><br>Once again, let us give our deepest respect to the great Supreme Guardian Alexandra."

After a grueling court process, the news that Gray Goethe was convicted of treason shocked Belobog... What happened exactly? Please stay tuned for our correspondent's analysis.<br><br>Shortly after Austin Goethe's passing, the brothers turned on each other over the will.<br><br>The Goethe family had a reputable name even before Belobog's founding, earning the trust and favor of the second Supreme Guardian \"Svetlana the Iron Fist.\" The Goethe family played an important role in unifying the powers in Belobog. With the recent passing of Austin Goethe, the core member of the family, Belobog's elites all attended his grand funeral.<br><br>However, Austin Goethe's will had not equally distributed of his wealth between his sons, causing great disputes. In the will, the elder son Wyatt was entitled to sixty-five percent of wealth, while the younger son Gray only received twenty percent. The rest of Austin's wealth was merged into the family trust and will be managed by a third-party, periodically issuing allowances to his grandchildren. Gray protested strongly against this distribution, and the relationship between the brothers completely broke down over the two months of court hearings.<br><br>Gray was extremely agitated when he was being interviewed and said, \"My father wouldn't have left such an absurd will — We're both his sons, so why are we treated differently? Someone must have tampered with the will... This will... I won't accept this will!\"<br><br>Compared to Gray's rage, Wyatt seemed to be quite calm. He believes that the will is legally sound and undisputed. \"Gray never came to visit even when Dad was ill, but came every single day asking about the money the moment Dad passed. I am very disappointed in him.\"<br><br>The dispute over the will ended with the court ruling in Wyatt's favor.<br><br>Gray vanishes and commits treason after losing the lawsuit. Wyatt sells family property to pay for fines.<br><br>Just as everyone thought the drama was coming to an end with Gray's loss, the city was shocked when Supreme Guardian Tatiana declared Gray Goethe had committed grave treason and heavily fined the family. The <i>Crystal Daily</i> had immediately contacted the spokesperson of Qlipoth Fort and the Goethe Family. We still have not received a reply from either party at the time of writing. Reliable sources state that Gray Goethe had already left the Administrative District and gone missing.<br><br>The details of Gray's treason have not been announced publicly. However, the Supreme Guardian was firm with the accusation and Wyatt Goethe, Gray's brother, did not protest. We had however received an official response from the Qlipoth Fort spokesperson on the recent rumor that Gray and his family had escaped into the Snow Plains. No such incident had occurred.<br><br>\"Extreme prosperity forebodes the beginning of the decline. That is the teaching of the Goethe family. We are well aware of its meaning, but no one thought it would come so soon... and so sudden...\" Wyatt's gaze dulled as he talked about the future of the Goethe family. \"I have been forced to sell off the family mansion and fire nearly half the maids. I hope to use the remaining funds to start my own business and re-establish my family's good name to compensate for the crimes of my younger brother.\""

As there are very few signs of life outside of Belobog, the Silvermane Guards have not kept a strict watch over Belobog's exits. Recently, a number of citizens have reported sightings of direwolves in Belobog territory. It would seem the warm environment of Belobog has attracted and encouraged the cold-weathering beasts to migrate to this area. These sightings have the full attention of the Silvermane Guards and roughly 1100 Silvermane Guards will be dispatched through the entire city to make sure there are no risks involving direwolves. We will also use this as an opportunity to increase our management over the city's traffic and prevent any dangerous creatures from entering in the future.<br><br>Tatiana emphasized once again that all personnel other than Silvermane Guards on security duty are not allowed outside their homes every day from 6 PM to 6 AM.

I am Klenova, the fourth head of the Geomarrow Development Group.<br><br>When the Eternal Freeze approached in the past, the Geomarrow stores on the surface were immediately consumed. Under the command of the great Guardian Alisa Rand, humanity began to march towards the unknown deep underground — That was when the Geomarrow Development Group was created with our great mission.<br><br>— If the Belobog historians were to write a record of Geomarrow development, they would likely start from that time point. However, the truth was that another group of pioneering explorers had dug underground before we did, and the arrival of the Eternal Freeze was long after them. The Supreme Guardian made the Geomarrow Development Group an important organization under the command of the Architects. Our job is to always dig deeper and maintain a flow of Geomarrow to the surface so that Belobog can function. But apart from digging for Geomarrow, we have a more important mission: To create a subterranean ecosystem.<br><br>I have only heard about the sights in the underground from my father's letters. I could not tell what was real amongst his passionate and exaggerated descriptions. And yet, when I actually had the chance to join the Group and start exploring, I finally discovered the things he said were no illusions.<br><br>The Group and I discovered a final, unsent letter when we were sorting out his belongings. He wrote: \"...Nova, I had never mentioned this to you, but I spent my childhood in the mountains far from Belobog. At that time, I felt the entire world belonged to me, and I could go anywhere I wanted. However, after the Eternal Freeze arrived, children of your generation never left Belobog.\"<br><br>\"I thought perhaps we will discover oceans and mountain ranges underground. Perhaps, in the future, we can also live underground...\"<br><br>\"I really hope I can see that day together with you.\"<br><br>I had kept all of the letters he sent me, including this one. I remember his wish and I know I must fulfill it — With the Furnace Core research station as a base, we will keep excavating Geomarrow mines. At the end of this year, we will formally establish the first underground mining town. That is, however, only the first step. I hope more towns will appear underground in Belobog in the future, and we might even build cities as beautiful as the Overworld. We might even connect all the regions above ground and underground using train rails, so the old world and the new would not be separated...<br><br>— At that time, we will no longer have to crouch in tiny shelters to evade the snow, and will find where we truly belong in this new world.<br><br>At the same time, the historical mission of the Group is about to come to an end. The information we gathered will be used to explore the future, including our geological, mineralogical, and biological data including the knowledge on flora, fauna, and micro-organisms. As of now, most of us will temporarily return to our respective institutes for scientific research. But personally, I will definitely return to the underground after I retire in a few years.<br><br>Therefore, there is no need to feel sad for the coming farewell. Simply wait till the Supreme Guardian renovates this place into the first transport channel connecting above and below ground. This small Furnace Core base will be completely changed and continue to shine for the mission of underground exploration. Until that time, our friend big Svarog will protect this place for us, so the traces we leave behind won't disappear. We know that though he doesn't talk much, he has always protected us with great loyalty. I believe he will keep his promise this time as well. He is our best compatriot.<br><br>Everything with a beginning has an end. Now is the time to say goodbye.<br><br>I salute you all, the Geomarrow Development Group, and all members of the Furnace Core Research Station!<br><br>Head of the Geomarrow Development Group, Klenova"

They don't understand why the world just suddenly changed.

The work here at the army is just too much, and I can't take a holiday.<br><br>However, rest assured. We are pretty far from the front line, so we are quite safe. The Supreme Guardian herself has also been here commanding the troops for the past few months. Everyone is working at their posts, so I can't really sneak off on my own.<br><br>Mom, I'm dreaming a lot about when I was just a child. I remember how I complained you always came off work so late and didn't pay any attention to our family. What did you say to me then? You said \"It is my responsibility,\" but I didn't understand it. Now, Belobog is facing a crisis that is growing more and more dire, and I finally understood the responsibility an \"Architect\" should carry. As the war worsened, I actually join an unannounced big project recently. Sorry, Mom, I can't tell you what it is even though you work for the design institute. I can only say it involves the most majestic creation of the Architects that I have ever seen. I'm lucky as it is to be a part of the team. Wow, I never thought there'd be a day when I'd feel so proud of my job...<br><br>I wish you could see it in action. I swear any enemy would be stricken by paralyzing fear by the mere sight of it. However, the Supreme Guardian said this creation would only be activated if Belobog stands at the brink of destruction. In that case, I wish you never get to know what we're making.<br><br>Anyways, let's talk about something else — The command center was completed last month and our goods were gradually being moved in. I put a pot of solarflower on my desk and it's growing pretty well. Every time I looked at it, I'd think about the flowers in our living room. How are they doing? You also liked to knit while sitting next to the window. Do you still do that, now the Eternal Freeze is getting worse? The gift I asked Betty take back is to protect your knees. You always said your knees hurt in cold weather. I know a few Silvermanes here who just got back from their mission, and they got some wolf manes made into a knee pad. Please remember to use them.<br><br>Lastly, this might be a bit late, but I still want to say — Happy Birthday, Mom.<br>Love, Lana"

Not only the Overworld, I heard even the Underworld was a little cold at night. Please take care of your body and don't catch a cold!<br><br>I'm writing this letter to tell you that my listed Overworld residence will be off the market soon. Also, I've settled the new shopfront in Rivet Town. I should be able to reopen the shop in two months when I return.<br><br>I did a little bit of math and subtracted the money I needed to buy the shopfront from the money I got from selling the house, as well as the debt I still owe, I still have around 800,000 credits to spare. Looks like I did make some money this trip to the Overworld. When I left for the Overworld, even selling everything I owned would've only amounted to 500,000.<br><br>Goodness me, the properties in the Overworld have been rising without fail — even if I sold my current residence and bought a new one, the money I got from selling the house would just be enough for the down payment, that's pretty much the same as when I arrived at the Overworld. In those days I had to scrap for pennies, only eating even half a Belobog Sausage when I had some extra money, and had to resort to drinking snow water to stave off the hunger. I really don't want to live that life anymore. Side note, I really don't want to have any Belobog Sausage for the rest of my life, no matter what flavor it is.<br><br>I originally wanted to approach my real estate agent and haggle more, but forget it, I'll just start a clean slate. After all, the Overworld life can eat you alive, I really don't want to stay there a minute longer. Especially that Bank of Belobog, they're so ridiculous! It's only, what, a few days late, it's not like I wasn't going to pay the debt! When I took out the loan, they were all so amiable, but when it was time to collect the debt, they were almost going to swallow me alive! Rivet Town is still the best with all our neighborly sensibilities.<br><br>Talking about this stuff makes my blood boil. I'll stop going on about it, I'm heading home soon anyway. I plan to do what I used to do and open up a tiny daily sundry shop. I won't earn as much, but a simple life has its charms. Unlike being in the Overworld where work-life balance is barely a thought in mind.<br><br>Look at me, talking about the Overworld again. Never mind that though, I finally got through the hardest part of it. Don't worry about me, Mom. I'll send you another letter when I'm done with everything here.<br><br>Wishing you health and joy!<br><br>Your Dearest Son,<br>Robert Modric"

Under the protection of the Architects, the Silvermane Guards continue to push back the monsters as news of good tidings keeps rolling back from the frontline. Our great guardian, Madam Cocolia, keenly noticed that the time for counterattack has come!<br><br>The Rivet Town Administrative Committee and the Chamber of Commerce hereby announce the supreme guardian's decree: From this day on, both armies of the Overworld and Underworld shall assemble and move toward the Fragmentum in the Overworld!

If you have any ideas, let me know.<br>— Gertie<br><br>New Item of the Week: Wild Herb Soup<br>Customer Comments:<br>1. It looks kind of bad. It's all goopy and stuff, so it turned me off a bit.<br>— Don<br>2. It's called \"Wild Herb\" soup, but it's actually moss from the cave. The texture is refreshingly nice! The moss is cooked to the point of melting-in-your-mouth, and it took on the broth's sweet-and-sour taste. It's hearty but not heavy, such a wonderful palate cleanser. I do agree with the comment above though. Maybe change the name, or other customers may complain.<br>— Saunders<br>Chef's Response:<br>Understood. I'm okay as long as its taste is good. I'll think of a new name, but because the moss supply is not stable, I'm not even sure I want to put it on the menu.<br><br>New Item of the Week: Iron Pot Braised Olm<br>Customer Comments:<br>1. Did you get the iron pot from some decommissioned machines? It's cleaned, but some parts of the edge are a little rusty. It kills my appetite a little.<br>— Don<br>2. I can't blame Don for being fussy. The gravy was nicely done, but I got burned a few times by the metal while trying to eat it. Gertie, is there a reason you insisted on using the iron pot? Please consider switching to a different container.<br>— Saunders<br>Chef's Response:<br>I apologize. I recently read in an old cookbook that \"iron pots are perfect for simmered soups and stewed dishes because they can maximize the deliciousness of the food itself.\" Let me think on how to improve on it, I'm so sorry that it burned you.<br><br>New Item of the Week: Improved Iron Pot Braised Olm<br>Customer Comments:<br>1. The addition of crust is interesting, makes the tin can look much classier. Gertie, will you decorate the crust?<br><br>— Don<br>2. Is that crust added on top of the iron pot? The only weak spot of the dish has now become its feature! The crust is warmed by the residual heat until it is crispy, coupled with the tender Olm meat, dipped into the gravy in the pot. I daresay this can be the restaurant's pièce de résistance just from this little tweak!<br><br>— Saunders<br>Chef's Comment:<br>Don, stop asking, I said no! Even if you ask me ten thousand times, I will not decorate the crust!<br>Saunders, thank you for your constructive criticism. If it wasn't for you, I might not have realized the overheating issue with the pot. This dish will start being on the menu tomorrow onward. If you're coming over to eat, it's on the house, no worries!<br><br>New Item of the Week: Candied Mushrooms with Pepper<br>Customer Comments:<br>1. Appetizing but not filling enough. It's not even large enough to get stuck in my tooth gap. I had to go home and have about six pieces of rye bread.<br>— Don<br>2. It's a cold dish, this is unusual. The roasted candied mushroom paired with the hammer pepper flakes makes the sensations come in layers. The spice kicks in just as the sweetness fades. As an appetizer, its portion looked a little small, I finished it before I noticed.<br>— Saunders<br>Is there a non-spicy version? It tastes great, but I don't do well with spicy food *sobs* .<br>— Elaine<br>Chef's Response:<br>A non-spicy version? I have yet to find a replacement for hammer peppers, so I'm sorry but I probably won't be able to make it on short notice. Only the spicy version will be on the menu two days from now. As for Don, if your tooth gap is so wide, I advise you to have your teeth looked at.<br><br>New Item of the Week: Rat Jelly<br>Customer Comments:<br>1. Meat jelly, my childhood favorite! But is it possible to not say \"rat\" in the name of the dish itself? I'm a little squeamish, I worry my childhood favorite will become my childhood trauma.<br>— Don<br>2. Jelly can be considered a featured dish only locals would know of. The Mad Mole meat doesn't taste gamey at all. Mixed in with minced garlic, there's something indescribably satisfying in having my mouth stuffed full of meat. The yogurt dip is soft and airy, and at the same time not too creamy, making it taste way better than the traditional fish jelly.<br>— Saunders<br>3. As expected of Chef Gertie! This reminds me of the era when each and every family made their own meat jelly.<br>— Elaine<br>Chef's Response:<br>I'll change the name to Flavorful Jelly then. Putting on the menu next week onward.<br><br><br>New Item of the Week: Grilled Mushrooms<br>Customer Comments:<br>1. Gertie, you have been toeing the line in your pursuit for ingredient freshness. There's a reason why the mushrooms on the market have always been those few species. The ones you're using are all inedible.<br>— Saunders<br>2. I have never seen mushrooms this colorful, can they really be eaten?<br>— Antonia<br>3. The portion is quite filling and the taste is okay, but it will cause diarrhea after eating, it's quite a challenge for the customer's digestive system.<br>— Don<br>Chef's Response:<br>Really? I apologize, I hope everyone's doing okay...<br><br><br>New Item of the Week: Deep-Fried Rock Crab<br>Customer Comments:<br>1. Rock Crabs themselves are extremely tasty, but are not suitable for deep-frying, which makes it difficult to bite into the shell. I had to smash it with a rock to get the meat inside the pincers.<br>— Saunders<br>2. Gertie, are you not able to clean out the gravel on the crab? The tiny rocks coated the shell and are pretty much indistinguishable from the shell after deep-frying, it almost cracked my teeth while eating.<br>— Antonia<br>Chef's Response:<br>The seller told me not to wash it too well, or some of the freshness would be lost when cooking it. I have yet to master the balance of this, so I do give my apologies, however late it may be."

It's all for survival anyway, and at least this is a step up.<br>I had a look at the vein they found. It's quite something, no wonder people want it for their own.<br><br>December 2, Thursday<br>Steve asked me if I would like to join their mining team, specifically to help them maintain the machinery. I said yes, as long as there's food. I'm very grateful to Steve. Unlike the others, he really takes care of me.<br>Maybe later I'll save up a little to bring him for a meal in a nearby town together with those guys I traveled with. I heard there is a Goethe Grand Hotel in Boulder Town, and the owner's wife is a pretty good cook.<br>Rumor has it that a miner's private shield stash got stolen.

Earlier this year, I had the pleasure of meeting you and introducing myself to you at a charity event hosted by your family. But I know that a fine lady like you, who comes from a noble family and is well-educated and intelligent, would not care about such trivial matters.<br><br>I'd like to introduce myself once again. Oh, I genuinely hope you're the most brilliant lady, as the rumor has it.<br><br>I am Ryan, the founder of the Cosmic Association of Entrepreneurs, as well as the chairman of the Cosmos Energy Unlimited Group, and the founder of the Universe High Energy Metafield Space. Throughout the last ten years of hard effort, I was lucky to get long-distance counsel from an anonymous member of the \"Genius Society\" in my sleep, and when I awoke from my dream, I successfully created the Universe High Energy Metafield Space. I once submitted a business proposal to your group concerning the Metafield Space, but your offer did not meet the value I expected, and I passed up an excellent opportunity to work with you.<br><br>However, I am the founder of the Association of Entrepreneurs, and several of our keen members have informed me of your email address via our extensive network. You are, in my opinion, the most gifted heir of the great families in the last few centuries. Furthermore, I am aware of your family's involvement in the IPC. As a result, I'd like to invite you to join me in starting a business. Only a young prodigy of noble lineage and great potential, such as yourself, can realize how my incredible invention, the Universe High Energy Metafield Space, will certainly add the most dazzling touch to your legendary career.<br><br>(The business proposal is in the attachment, and the price I am willing to accept is as follows: You provide the investment, I take 60% of the shares, and you take 40%. This is an incredible opportunity!)<br>Ryan<br><br>Sent Email<br>To: Ryan@CosmosEnergyUnlimited<br>From: Asta@HertaSpaceStation<br>CC: Nina@IPCDataSecurityDepartment<br>Email Content:<br><br>After years of research, I discovered something new in the universe that no one else had observed: The universe contains a high-speed particle known as the scammer particle.<br><br>Scammer particles rotate at high speeds around normal organisms, forming the foundation of the metafield's elemental matter. Under constant external high-energy conceptual stimulation, the scammer particles leap to the high-energy state and then return to the low-energy state after a brief period of time, accumulating credits from the outside world.<br><br>However, there is another type of anti-particle among the stars, surrounded by a swarm of scammers. The anti-scammer particle will eventually explode and discharge its own energy, stripping the scammer particle of its positive valence form and causing it to disintegrate.<br><br>This antiparticle was discovered by me. You're a moron for trying to scam me.<br><br>Founder of the Anti-Scammer Particle Theory — Asta"

I clashed with him during a video call a few days ago, and he insisted on not allowing us to video talk with the hospital, so I'm not sure what the situation is with great-grandma. Your father is still on Planet Larchmont and hasn't returned, and he hasn't responded to any of the messages I've sent him, so I'm not sure what's going on.<br><br>But I think Balint... he probably just wants to continue exploiting the IPC, I don't think he will harm your great-grandmother. You don't have to be worried too much about your great-grandmother because the cosmos's best medical services are here, so there won't be any serious issues.<br>However, I am concerned about you, a girl out wandering to study the trail of stars or something. Balint appears to have become desperate recently, and I'm concerned that he'll do something horrible to you. You should hire some reliable security staff... but it's okay, I looked at your route, and the closest planet to you is ████, the coordinates are ████, and there is an IPC subsidiary there under my name. You can go right over there.

He had been hit by an electromagnetic storm, which rendered all communication devices unusable. Are you still looking for the elusive comet rail? If you aren't too busy, you should come back. There's been a lot going on lately at home. You should be wary of Aunt Taylor. The trust fund alerted me the other day that she forged an agreement to transfer your shares, but thankfully you did not cooperate... Anyway, I'll tell you all about it when you get home.<br><br>By the way, do you have enough money? I looked over last month's bill. How did you manage to spend such little money if you hired a scientific research fleet to accompany you on an expedition? Have you run out of pocket money yet?

I'm envious of your inherent compassion.<br><br>I remember giving a speech on stage when I first started school, waving my arms, and advocating for the development of \"Blizzard Immunity.\" In hindsight, I was a fool. During my final days of medical school, I became increasingly stubborn and withdrew into myself.

I owe the people of the Underworld too much already.<br><br>I might have spent the rest of my life as a madman wallowing in my convictions if you hadn't agreed to my desire for self-exile. The cold has revealed to me my arrogance. How can a child who grew up in warmth ever begin to comprehend a cure to bitter cold? Thank you for giving me one last chance to discover the answer.<br><br>I live in abandoned houses under broken roofs and continue my experiments. One step after another, I've made breakthroughs. I'm trembling, not because of the cold... but because I can feel I'm getting closer to the answer I seek... I'd become a pariah, unable to return to civilized society nor to face my parents... but I didn't despair, because I'd discovered the meaning of my existence. I had a feeling I was on the right track.<br><br>The reagents I developed in the Underworld have a serious flaw: The medication only addresses the issue of organ hypothermia and failure, and it will be caught in a never-ending vicious cycle of consumption and recovery. I should have changed the focus of my study a long time ago and tried to figure out how to raise the temperature of the organs and of the body in a controlled manner.<br><br>Natasha, thank you very much.

It was found in a place with some other small ancient relics, which I presume were mostly Old World households or personal objects. In terms of value, they won't make you rich overnight, but they're quite valuable.<br><br>Conrad pointed out that its shape was strange, even the great Miner's Lamp had trouble identifying it. The Old World is full of strange objects, but this object doesn't even come close to being the strangest. With a little thought, I can try analyzing it.<br><br>As usual, we'll start by analyzing its structure.<br><br>With how neat the arc is, I'm inclined to believe that it was designed that way, rather than being forced into this shape by \"an external force.\" The bulk of the weight is concentrated at the center, so the sides appear to supportive. The arc interior is a concave surface...<br><br>Don't think my words are too profound. When I appraise ancient relics, I must use professional and precise words.

Let's continue the appraisal.<br><br>The most striking thing about the exterior is the two curved pieces of metal. I've seen this before.<br><br>This is similar to something that I had appraised before. When the switch was flipped, two metal pieces made a crackling sound. I quickly shut it down for fear of what would happen. It smelled like something was burning, You wonder what it was? The man who brought the object to me put his hands directly on it. I'll just say, bless Ol' Man Copper that my hands aren't fast. You see, the key to identifying ancient relics is better safe than sorry. This philosophy has gotten me out of trouble many times.<br><br>So, I assume the metal parts are an electrode, which is the same as that thing. Wasn't it easy to deduce the function of this strangely shaped object?<br><br>The key to identifying ancient relics is knowledge. That will come naturally with experience.<br><br>Didn't you mention the key is supposed to be \"better safe than sorry\"? There are so many crucial factors to consider that it is hard to know them all. Why else would I be doing this line of business, and not you?<br><br>I went through manuscripts and magazines from the Old World. I found some similarly shaped handicrafts made from cloth. The magazines say that They were worn from the back of the neck. No wonder it was shaped like an arc! However, I was afraid of what would happen, so I called over Conrad and put the thing around his neck. And what do you know? It was a perfect fit. If someone from the Old World saw it, he would have said it's worn around the neck as well.<br><br>Conrad was overjoyed at how well it fit. He said the two pieces of metal fit comfortably on the nape of his neck and wondered what they were for. When I told him it was a torture device, he was so frightened that he took it off immediately. He lifted my chair and beat me hard. I was wronged! First of all, it wasn't powered. Secondly, I didn't even press the switch. Honestly!<br><br>Since I have not seen another ancient relic like it so far, its rarity is temporarily set at four stars. Although it is a torture device, its effect is mild compared to the relics that can heat up and explode.

Gradually, a shape began to take form, but it was taking up too much of my time. You can call me stupid, but it felt like some mysterious force was holding me back.

Don't invent these magic objects in the first place. Just invent powerful weapons, so the king can suppress the coup. Then, I'd be able to make some money by selling those weapons, right?<br><br>For safety concerns, I stopped trying to piece the metal blocks back together. It's not that I can't, but I don't like the thought of being possessed by an evil spirit from the Old World. Why would I want to? There's nothing left to reclaim. It's all just useless junk. Restoring the country? There's just no point. I might as well just give up.<br><br>But here's the twist.<br><br>— Someone finished the puzzle when I wasn't looking!<br><br>He didn't even say anything. I don't even know if he was possessed by an evil spirit! And worst of all, he just left the metal blocks there after completing it. I respect him for not stealing, but why would you just leave it there? What if a ghost pops out afterwards?<br><br>So, I sold it immediately.<br><br>Last I heard, that neat little pyramid was being used to press the lid of a kimchi jar.

As it matures into adulthood, their leathery scales will produce Krystalloid, which will vary in color depending on the region, temperature, and health of the lizard. Experts have pointed out that Crystalline Lizards expel Geomarrow and other minerals from their salt glands through the osmotic pressure in the body. The Krystalloid is a byproduct of regulating the osmotic balance of body fluids.<br><br>The randomness of the Krystalloid color has sparked a wave of collectors, who are willing to pay exorbitant prices for wild Crystalline Lizards with a rare color. This has caused an ecological imbalance in the mines. In the past, many pest outbreaks have been tied to the decline in the Crystalline Lizard population. In response, Belobog has prohibited the hunting of wild Crystalline Lizards.<br><br>The alkaloids in the body fluid of the Crystalline Lizard are often used in pharmaceutics. This body fluid is dissolved in water and made into a spray. When the spray is applied to a patient, the droplets reach the pulmonary alveoli via the upper respiratory tract and are shown to drive out mineral dust in the lung via the bronchi, preventing the dust from entering the interstitial lung and lymph nodes. Researchers, however, do not understand fully how this process works. Thus, it is common for Underworld doctors to breed Crystalline Lizards in captivity, but they don't have any value to the collectors.<br><br>Geomarrow Olm<br><br><i>\"This amphibian survives solely on pure energy!\"</i><br><br>Geomarrow Olm is an amphibian that burrows near underground water sources. With white and pink feathery scales, its highly-developed hearing and smell make up for its degraded vision. It's able to survive both on land and in the water. According to the Geomarrow Development Group, populations of Geomarrow Olm were always found near large mines, for reasons unknown. People assumed that these olms fed on Geomarrow, hence the name.<br><br>Biologists have pointed out that the Geomarrow Olms live in an environment lacking in food. This severe environment has caused them to evolve into organisms with superior metabolism and antioxidant capacity. They are capable of surviving without food for up to 10 years, due to their slow metabolism and limited movement. However, it is scientifically reasonable to assume that they could survive more than 15 years without feeding. So, experts believe that it is more likely that their feeding behaviors are hard to observe, rather than draw the conclusion that they feed on Geomarrow.<br><br>The Geomarrow Olms by nature are afraid of and reside away from the humans in darker and more moist areas. The Geomarrow Olms do not pose a threat to humans.<br><br>Funeral Worm<br><br><i>\"When it's time to bury a corpse, these worms never pass up the opportunity for a feast.\"</i><br><br>Funeral Worms are a subspecies of coleoptera commonly found in underground caves. They range in lengths of up to 3.5 centimeters, with an average length of 1.2 centimeters. They are usually black and orange in appearance. Their flat soft bodies allow them to crawl under animal carcasses. After discovering a potential animal carcass, they gather in swarms around the body. They spend a great deal of time confirming that the animal is dead before they dig the ground beneath it to decompose it.<br><br>Funeral worms observing a dead animal is similar to attending a funeral, hence the name. Some biologists have suggested their unique habits may be related to creatures who barely move, like the Geomarrow Olm. If they misjudge prey, they might become prey themselves. Funeral worms are one of the most important parts of underground ecology, breaking down carcasses and feces of a wide range of animals. They are also commonly found in cemeteries and bat caves."

Isn't it common knowledge?</i><br>Adult Crystal Scorpions are almost entirely covered with highly transparent carapaces. Growing up to five or six centimeters long, the body is clearly segmented into two: Head and chest, and the abdomen. There are six pairs of appendages on the head and chest. The first pair is used for feeding. The second pair is threatening crab-like claws for attacking and defending, and for touching things. The remaining appendages are all used for movement. The abdomen is the scorpion tail, which is bent forward and poisonous. The venom is not lethal to humans, but it will cause a burning sensation.<br><br>The transparent carapace for which the Crystal Scorpion is famous turns out to be a mimicry of Geomarrow, and not some expensive crystal. While Geomarrow dust is processed from the body, it assimilates with the hard shell to form this unique transparent shell. With its help, Crystal Scorpions can feed on Crystal Lizards who live near Geomarrow.<br><br>During the period in which Crystal Lizards were hunted by collectors, crystal scorpions were also hunted. As a result, their population was reduced significantly to the point where they're now considered a rare and endangered species. They are traded at high prices in underground markets.<br><br><br>Mad Moles<br><br><i>\"I can't help but wonder what would happen if I had the misfortune of stumbling into their burrow while exploring the dark depths of a cave?\"</i><br><br>The Mad Moles have stout powerful limbs and well-developed claws, which are good for digging. However, they would much prefer to use their head and teeth. Their eyes are completely defunct, with little or no vision. They have no outer ear, and the ear shell is a small fold of skin around the ear hole. With short tails that are slightly longer than their hind feet, the moles are usually bare or a little hairy. People once thought they fed primarily only on plant roots, but it is now common knowledge that they are omnivores.<br><br>Ecologists have discovered that Mad Moles have a number of distinct characteristics that are detrimental to the species' survival. Now, researchers believe that the rapid spread of Fragmentum is at the root of these characteristics: Mad Moles appear to be more sensitive to a specific substance in Fragmentum than other species. As a result, they have become extremely aggressive, with the ability to swarm and devour mammals several or even dozens of times their size.<br><br>Then, it is the never-ending hell of survival. Mad Moles rarely leave their burrows, but keep expanding them because of two factors: First, Mad Moles have a severe sensitivity to specific substances in the surface atmosphere, making it impossible for them to survive outside of their burrows. Second, the Fragmentum hastens the deterioration of their limited habitat. As a result, Mad Moles must keep searching for new habitats underground. If an unfortunate creature were to fall into its burrow, the moles would eat it. If there were no such creatures, they would eat each other. There will always be a massive pile of bones in the Mad Moles' burrows.<br><br>However, their remarkable reproductive capacity more than compensates for their low survival qualities. Even if the Mad Mole population is artificially reduced to a very small number, it still can quickly recover after a few months.<br><br>There was once an unfortunate miner who used to hear the moles scurrying behind the wall every night as he slept. He would experience chronic hallucinations and nightmares. Even when clear-headed, he would mumble in a language that no one could understand. Fortunately, the large burrow was connected to the stove in the kitchen. One night, soot, which hadn't been completed burned out, caught on fire and exterminated the mad moles. That miner was saved from a gruesome fate.<br><br>Rock Crab<br><br><i>There's no way this critter could have nearly destroyed Belobog!</i><br><br>The rock crab, a mix between a shrimp and a crab, likes to live inside rocks, and many of them use hard rocks as a shell for protection. According to research, the rock crab originally lived along the coastal regions. They were oceanic creatures that would dig through rocks to lay their eggs, then returned to the sea. After the Ice Age, the rock crabs bred in large numbers and moved underground to the warmer Belobog, causing massive tunnel collapses as they migrated. During this period, they were known as tunnel rock crabs. However, for reasons unknown, their population declined significantly, almost to the point of extinction.<br><br>Nowadays, rock crabs are considered a gourmet meal in the Underworld. Although the crab is rare and difficult to obtain, the delicious texture of its meat makes it a star ingredient in the underground. People usually steam the crab, but there are many other variations are loved by residents: Stir-fried crab meat with hammer peppers, salt-baked rock crab, and much more. Rock crab powder can also be combined with a variety of other ingredients for rich flavors.<br><br>With the dwindling rock crab population nowadays, many people doubt the old rumor that every family eats crab."

Sesame's been stolen by a bunch of bandits! Those thieves! Those scavengers! Trash!<br><br>I recognize their faces, they're thugs from the vagrant camp — they're good at selling relics.

How could you be sold for scrap...<br><br>When I found them, they said they'd already sold Sesame to Svarogs' vagrants and that it had probably already been salvaged by now.<br><br>Oh, Sesame! It'd be pointless for me to fight them now that you're gone... How could this be... I'd be better off dead...<br><br>After making a grave for Sesame, maybe...

I found out that he got into the ancient relic trade. He did that for a few years, but must have gotten into a turf war or something since I haven't heard anything of him lately.<br><br>A while back, he uncovered some letters in the machine graveyard that he couldn't sell on the relic market. I don't know why he tried — anything that isn't a relic is worthless there. He came to me out of desperation and asked if I'd take them. I only purchase aquatic goods, not garbage. If someone brings me rock crabs, no problem, but what am I supposed to do with letters?<br><br>Anyway, for old friendship's sake, I ended up buying them at a low price.<br><br>Even after I bought them he was still trying to fool me. He told me they contained sales reports on aquatic goods, which is why he sold them to me and not the collectors. Out of dozens of letters, there was only one that mentioned a type of crab — the tunnel rock crab. In all my years of being in this business, I'd never heard of it before.<br><br>Judging from the name, it's probably related to the standard rock crab, but maybe they're one and the same? I did hear a funny story about rock crabs. Rock crabs never use to hide in the rocks — they only started doing so to protect themselves from the hordes of people trying to eat them. Maybe that's when the crabs changed their own name?<br><br>Anyway, the letter mentioned there were many crabs in the underground mining area. Left unattended, they'd cause the tunnels to collapse in less than two hundred years, along with the city above. Well, it's been a long time and nothing has changed. The only difference is all the crabs are gone now, probably extinct from all of us eating them. I can tell the people back then didn't know much. They had nothing better to do than frighten themselves all day long.<br><br>If there were as many crabs now as there was back then, I wouldn't have to worry. The price of rock crabs is high, and they might already be extinct since I can't catch any. I may have to find a different job.<br><br>I heard you're currently studying history in Wildfire. I came across these letters and thought they could be useful to you, so I forwarded them over. All I ask in return is that you introduce me to the chef there. What do you think?<br><br>Marcel"

After falling off a cliff, he began his struggle to survive...</i><br><br>When Artem first joined the Ancient Relic Expedition Team, he was known as \"the most promising youth in the history of the expedition team.\"<br><br>He graduated at the top of his class from the best medical institute in Belobog, while also having degrees in archaeology and geology. His physical capabilities rival that of a professional athlete, and he has claimed multiple national rock-climbing championships as the head of the medical institute's rock-climbing association.<br><br>However, beneath the glamour and praise hides an extremely stubborn person, who's obsessed with the relics of the Old World. When Artem first joined the expedition team, he often became \"overly devoted\" to the studies of the ancient relics. He locked himself in the research institute for days, until the staff found him passed out on the lab floor.<br><br>\"What? I even forgot to eat!?\"<br><br>\"Yes, Artem. You even forgot to sleep!\"<br><br>\"That won't do. I'm gonna fill my stomach and get back to my research.\"<br><br>It was not until recently that he learned to keep some canned food in his drawer in the lab. This only made him stay even longer in the lab than before.<br><br>In the beginning, many young ladies set their eyes on Artem, for a little while at least. But everyone soon realized that the humanoid organism named Artem seems to be unable to develop emotional connections with others. What a pity.<br><br>In his own words, \"For now, I just want to adventure.\"<br><br>The Ancient Relic Expedition Team belongs to the Belobog Museum. They are a team of adventurers responsible for finding Old World relics in the areas surrounding Belobog. Retrieved relics will be studied extensively by archeologists and historians. However, their work must be done in a harsh blizzard environment. Dangerous situations and accidents are frequent in this line of work, which requires both wisdom and courage. Without a doubt, these archeologists are the true explorers of Belobog.<br><br>It shouldn't come as a surprise that the explorers may die at any moment.<br><br>This moment was no different.<br><br>Artem moved towards the cliff face as he dragged the lower half of his body with difficulty. The wind was much weaker here, making sure he can breathe a little easier before his inevitable death. His vision was blurry, but he couldn't tell whether it was due to the blizzard or if his eyes were wounded. He tried looking up the cliff where he probably fell from.<br><br>Did the team member he pulled up find safety? He must have, right? It was only a matter of time before he joined the other team members. That's a relief...<br><br>...<br><br>He was exhausted, and his vision gradually grew dim. If he fell asleep now, during this blizzard, he would never wake up, that's for sure. The heavy abdominal bleeding had frozen solid, and Artem was unsure of how he would eventually die. It hardly mattered to him at this point.<br><br>As the blizzard grew more violent, Artem would soon become a corpse just like the ones that he had passed by on previous adventures. It gave him some relief to think he wouldn't be alone.<br><br>...<br><br>He was just three years old when he climbed the drainpipe to the rooftop, much to the horror of his parents... What was happening? Was his life already flashing before his eyes? Ah, how many memories does one make in a lifetime...<br><br>Artem had drifted off to sleep under the cliff.<br><br>The flame of his life flickered in the blizzard. It was about to die out."

Everything here was made from \"Rain Water,\" and the residents here lived in harmony with the wind and the snow. Artem was amazed by the wondrous sights built from special materials...</i><br><br>As the flow of time continued, Artem found himself lying in a medical facility.<br><br>However, this medical facility had nothing in common with Belobog's Architects' Charice Hospital. No hospital in Belobog would have beds made of crystals. It wasn't until Artem noticed the IV drip attached to his arm that he realized he was being treated.<br><br>There was drumming in his ears. His eyes were only able to make out the blurred, burning lights around him. Apparently, his motor skills haven't returned. What's for sure is that he had almost crossed over to the other side.<br><br>The first person he met after being discharged from the hospital was the girl that helped him in his dreams.<br><br>\"Congratulations on your recovery.\"<br><br>\"Thank you. Could you tell me where... Who are you... I should probably introduce myself first... No, wait...\"<br><br>Artem was filled with questions. His words became jumbled, and he was unable to form a complete sentence.<br><br>\"My name is Anna.\"<br><br>\"I'm A—Artem...\"<br><br>Unlike the first time they met, Anna didn't tie her hair. The light shone through her long flaxen hair with translucent edges. The soft glow made her hair look as if it was delicately lifted. Her long eyelashes and calming eyes matched her thin face perfectly. In the past, Artem tried to avoid observing a woman's facial features for too long. With Anna, however, he couldn't stop until both their faces were flushed with embarrassment.<br><br>Perhaps it had something to do with his life having been saved, but Artem felt something he had never felt before.<br><br>Just as Artem had predicted, he was not in Belobog.<br><br>It was a city that had been built in the blizzard. People called it the Frozen City.<br><br>Different from Belobog, the Frozen City's forebears used the Old World technology to survive in the blizzard and preserve the spark of the Old World civilization. Artem was in the happiest phase of a culture shock. Everything was brand-new to him, like in one of his countless dreams, in which the technologies of the past lying dormant in the museum come back to life. Accompanied by Anna, this city gradually unfolded before Artem.<br><br>\"They should have also injected an Edelweiss into your body during your surgery.\"<br><br>\"Edelweiss... What is Edelweiss?\"<br><br>\"Ah, how should I put it? It's like a small... machine?\"<br><br>\"Machine? I thought machines were big things with chains, gears, valves, and steam? They... can be injected into the body?\"<br><br>\"I don't understand the principle very well. I just know all residents of Frozen City are injected with Edelweiss at birth. We do not fear the cold because of it. When I was little, the explorers told me that outsiders wear heavy clothes to stay warm. It wasn't until I saw you that I realized it was true.\"<br><br>\"So in the eyes of the local population, such warm clothes must be quite an unusual view... Right, speaking of which, are there other cities in this world besides Frozen City?\"<br><br>\"But of course, the world is a big place.\"<br><br>Anna suddenly stopped in her tracks, and Artem followed suit. In the clearing in front of them, a group of uniformed men gathered around a cannon, which was pointed at the sky, as if ready to fire, only waiting for someone to light the fuse.<br><br>\"Are they planning to shoot the cannon at the building across from here?\"<br><br>\"Hahahaha...\" Anna couldn't help but laugh at his genuine question. She wasn't used to guiding outsiders. \"You're not wrong, but they're planning to construct a new building here.\"<br><br>\"Construct a new building?\"<br><br>\"Yes, but since it hasn't taken shape yet, I don't know what it will be.\"<br><br>The cannon fired into the sky and thick clouds began to form above the clearing. Moments later, the water Anna called \"rain\" fell from the sky.<br><br>\"Rain Water\" was a rare term that Artem only read about in the museum archives. He had never witnessed it before. It was a common weather condition in the Old World. Only snow would fall from the skies in Belobog.<br><br>It wasn't until this moment that Artem understood that the cold snowflakes at home could fall in such a gentle way.<br><br>The Rain Water didn't disperse as it fell on the open ground. Instead, it quickly solidified into a concrete shape, as if sculpted by invisible hands. As the rain continued to fall, the outline of the building became clearer. The style was much different from those in Belobog.<br><br>A building tens of meters high was completed before Artem's eyes in a matter of minutes, like a miracle.<br><br>Anna was no longer surprised by the shock in Artem's eyes. She explained that all buildings in Frozen City were created from the miracle Rain Water. If the weather monitor Cloudship detected an incoming blizzard, these buildings would be converted into water on command, then transformed into new buildings as the people of Frozen City migrated to a more hospitable area.<br><br>Unique blueprints were traded among residents. Strange buildings rose every day. There was nothing more natural to the locals than that.<br><br>..."

This is how he'll get to meet Dalmir of the Lava Kingdom...</i><br><br>Responding to the summon, Artem arrived at the Frozen City's Crystal Palace. He had no issues finding the place, as the palace's grand dome could be seen from anywhere in the streets.<br><br>Under the guidance of the soldier in charge of guest reception, Artem passed through the main hall and entered the most prized part of the Crystal Palace, the hall of history. The glimmering light of the dawning sun cast a delicate outline upon the corridor walls.<br><br>Following Artem's footsteps, the sculptures of the ancient heroes and kings began to move. The spears in their hands extended forward, slowly reaching towards the evil monsters. Their cloaks swayed in the air, as if dancing alongside gusts of wind. However, all movement came to an end as Artem stoped.<br><br>Artem had spent his fair share of time in museums. Trying to uncover stories hidden within the silent relics was part of his daily work. He was familiar with the techniques used by ancient artists and got used to ignoring symbolic adornments, so he could get right to the history itself. He couldn't help but slow down to gaze upon the magnificent works in the corridor:<br><br>Emerging from the shattered sky, with golden blood running through THEIR veins, the God looks down upon the mortal word with cold and condescending eyes...<br><br>The warriors of the Frozen City were fighting the monster army. They wielded weapons emitting flames of death and wore armors that Artem has never seen before...<br><br>An armed vehicle the size of a mountain soared through the air like a snowgull. At the apex of this tidal wave of an army sat a woman with a diamond crown on her head. She was brandishing her spear, pointing it towards the merciless God in the sky...<br><br>Artem almost collapsed under the power emitting from the sculpture. He exhaled and noticed that the soldier leading him was observing his fascination with a smile. Artem gave him an apologetic look and quickly caught up with the soldier.<br><br>Artem was told by the soldier at the reception that he could move freely while waiting for the queen's summon.<br><br>Not long after he sat down, a ragged outsider came in and sat next to him. Before Artem could speak, the man introduced himself.<br><br>\"Hello, I'm Dalmir of the Lava Kingdom. I'd like to know...\"<br><br>\"I'm Artem of Belobog. I'm not a guest, just an adventurer that ran into trouble.\"<br><br>\"Belobog? I've never heard of it, but I'm glad to meet someone in the same line of work!\"<br><br>\"Same line of work? What an unexpected joy! Judging from your clothes, you must have experienced many thrilling adventures.\"<br><br>\"I guess thrilling would be an accurate description. I came here as a cannonball. It was eye-opening! I've never seen snowflakes before...\"<br><br>\"What did you say? You came here... as a cannonball?\"<br><br>\"Yeah, yeah! You put a man inside a cannon, then BOOM! The man's flying through the air, get it?\" Dalmir excitedly drew a parabola with his fingers.<br><br>\"I don't get it. How could a man survive that?\"<br><br>\"Here we go! This is my favorite moment. That incredible look on your face. Now I get to slowly explain my hometown to you. Haha, I'm used to it by now.\" Dalmir smiled proudly with his hands on his hips.<br><br>\"There are no snowflakes in the Lava Kingdom where I'm from. The difference in temperature is night and day compared to the Frozen City. There are many volcanoes where I live. Do you know about volcanoes? It's the complete opposite of snow mountains. Volcanoes have smoke coming out the top, and sometimes, they even spew fire.\"<br><br>Artem could not imagine a mountain so hot that it could breathe fire. All he could do was nod absently.<br><br>\"...And so, we used the power of the volcano to create a volcano cannon. We use it to launch adventurers, such as myself, to explore other countries. But it was only in the air that I realized the only way back was by walking. I guess that's how the previous adventurers returned home, hahaha!\"<br><br>Dalmir was naturally talkative. His words were full of passion that made Artem feel a sense of kinship. As they talked, Artem learned for the first time what a volcano was, what the movement of Earth's crust was, and what a volcano cannon was...<br><br>The Lava Kingdom adventurers are dispatched to explore the ends of the earth, but they can always find their way back with a compass that always points home. However, the trip back may be more dangerous than being launched by the cannon, and only a handful of adventurers make it. The ones who do make it always bring home reliable companions from foreign lands. The outsiders bring knowledge and technology that the Lava Kingdom would not normally have access to.<br><br>\"Artem, I need your help! Please come back with me to the Lava Kingdom. We must get there before the biggest volcanic event in history!\"<br><br>\"The biggest volcanic event in history...?\"<br><br>\"That's right! We're preparing our biggest volcano cannon yet.

His mind was like a drum head repeatedly pounded with new information.<br><br>\"Leave the ground... and head for the skies?\"<br><br>Each day, the world that Artem knew was repeatedly challenged by novel technologies, unknown histories, and distant, mysterious nations. Just as he thought nothing else would be able to surprise him, the man in front of him invited him to leave the land using a cannon powered by a volcano. He had no other choice...<br><br>\"With all due respect, I refuse!\"<br><br>\"What? I thought you'd be more adventurous than that. I was certain you would agree.\"<br><br>\"Those are two completely different issues. Going to a far and unfamiliar nation or climbing to heights never reached before may sound crazy to some people, but those feats are all within human logic and understanding. Using a volcano to launch yourself into the sky... that's just suicide!\"<br><br>After a short exchange, he bid his farewell to the adventurer from the volcano.<br><br>\"Maybe it's not that ruthless of an idea, young man.\" He took but a few steps when a commanding and soothing voice came from the side.<br><br>Only now did Artem notice a woman in expensive clothing staring at him from not too far. Based on what she was wearing, Artem immediately realized who it was and bowed. The woman smiled back.<br><br>\"May I ask you a question? Adventurer from Belobog, why did you embark on this perilous journey?\"<br><br>\"Perhaps... restlessness runs in my blood?\" Artem pondered for a moment, then shook his head.<br><br>\"Perhaps life is too peaceful in Belobog. We hide in a greenhouse and listen to the preaching of the speakers day after day. Soldiers guard our borders, stopping monsters from entering our city and preventing our people from leaving. If you work hard, you don't have to worry about food or shelter. But every day is the same. Life is peaceful without any changes. People are afraid of an unstable future and losing the life to which they've grown accustomed. Belobog's history is hundreds of years old, but nobody has ever truly left.\"<br><br>\"I don't want to read the same newspaper every day. I don't want to cover my eyes and ears and pretend the world is the size of our city. I want to know if I can survive a life that's not so peaceful.\"<br><br>The woman smiled. \"It seems you were born in the wrong place. You are different from the other Belobog people I know.\"<br><br>\"There have been other people of Belobog who arrived here?\"<br><br>\"That was over a hundred years ago, and it ended regrettably. Fortunately, the Frozen City relocates constantly, and the disaster of war was avoided.\"<br><br>Artem was listening to the words coming out of the woman's mouth in shock. \"You mean to say, Belobog and Frozen City almost went to war?\"<br><br>\"From then on, we have been weary of all visitors from that country.\" The woman raised her hand to stop his questioning. \"As you can see, the Frozen City is not built from unchanging ice. It is built from water, free of prejudice.\"<br><br>\"A man must be judged like a gem, by being examined from all sides. I have heard Anna's description of you. We have read about your adventures. And now, I have seen you. By the standards of the Frozen City, you are a remarkable man.\"<br><br>\"I thank you for your kind judgment, Your Majesty.\" Artem lowers his head.<br><br>\"Let's return to the topic at hand. I asked you before why you embarked on this perilous journey. Your response proved your wish to be free of constraints and live a life without a mundane routine. Frozen City, Lava Kingdom... You have heard and seen many wondrous things that most people can only dream of. But this city is bound to the skies, just as Belobog is bound to the land. Do you understand what I mean?\"<br><br>\"I... understand, Your Majesty. I just have a hard time believing that people can fly through the air.\" Artem murmured, \"I thought only birds could do that. I can't tell if Dalmir's invitation is suicidal madness or an adventurous gamble.\"<br><br>\"Is there any difference between the two? The spirit of adventure is a precious quality that goes against the humankind's natural survival instinct. It may seem worthless, but it is this spirit that allowed the people of the Old World to reach unimaginable heights. Strictly speaking, adventures and explorations are part of the heritage of the Old World.\"<br><br>\"You wouldn't be able to see what the Frozen City looks like, if you had decided to live peacefully behind the Belobog walls. Dalmir was not lying when he mentioned the Satelleden. It is a miracle, located so high up that it's invisible to the naked eye, left behind by the Old World civilization. People have long forgotten what it was like nowadays,\" the Queen sighed regrettably.<br><br>\"You've walked through the Snow Plains in search of ancient relics, all so that you could obtain the Old World heritage. The way back has already been covered in snow, Artem. The only way is forward, for you... and for the Frozen City, as it always has been.\"<br><br>\"I will take that into consideration.\" Artem mused for a bit and let out a long sigh. \"I will go talk to Dalmir.\"<br><br>Suddenly, the queen's face turned stern. \"I don't mean to persuade you, young Artem. Impulse will take you on adventures, but that alone will not take you to the ends of the earth. Regardless what you choose, I have a gift for you.\"<br><br>The Queen extended her hands from beneath her cloak. She held out a one-cubit long wand to Artem. The wand was forked on one end, the shape of which resembled a double-headed eagle.<br><br>\"Young Artem, we do not bow here in the Frozen City. But, as a token of respect towards the wisdom of the Old World, kneel down on one knee. Bow, not to me, but the Old World.\"<br><br>The Queen took hold of the wand. Suddenly, liquid began to flow over the surface, forming a blueish ice blade.<br><br>She turned the blade with incredible speed and touched Artem once on each shoulder and on the top of his head. Artem felt the ice breathing and jumping on his shoulders.<br><br>\"May your path be clear, your luck persist, and your courage prevail.\"<br><br>\"This blade's technology comes from the Old World. I present it to you, knight of the frozen city. To the sky, it is but a needle. To the earth, it is but a tool to cut through obstacles. But to you, it is the courage to move forward in the face of danger.\"<br><br>\"Go now, Artem.\""

Though the soil was rich and the plantations ample, danger was still lurking in every corner of this pleasant place. Dangers such as never before seen gigantic insects...</i><br><br>The fertile environment gave birth to vigorous growth. The soil beneath his feet felt like a soft mattress. Artem took off his jacket and walked through the grass field with weeds as high as his knees. A soft breeze passed by with the scent of the fresh blades of grass. Artem never thought such a gentle wind existed in the world.<br><br>He gently held on to Anna's hand, and she accepted his advance.<br><br>For a split second, an idea passed through Artem's mind: \"Stay, and spend the rest of the life with Anna here.\" But he quickly cleared his head of the selfish thought when he looked at the girl standing beside him, who had entrusted him with everything. He would be letting her down if he were to follow his selfish urges.<br><br>Before the three could enjoy more than just a sudden moment of peace, a rapid buzzing noise rose in the sky. The strange noise brought a prickling pain to their heads. A monster, like a bird, dashed through the sky flapping its glass-like transparent wings at astonishing speeds.<br><br>Instinctively, Dalmir covered his ears and dropped to the ground, and began praying to some god. After having experienced being taken away by monsters, he has always been the first to react to similar dangers. Artem fought the pain in his eardrums as he covered Anna with his body and knelt to the floor. He realized that he might have seen monsters like these somewhere before.<br><br>The danger from the sky lands softly on the ground, retracting its mesh-like wings, and stood still like a horrific statue.<br><br>Was that... a mosquito? Artem finally recalled from the depths of his memories the description he once read in an encyclopedia of the Old World regarding the monstrosity before him.<br><br>In the Old World era, the world was divided into four distinct seasons. Mosquitoes were blood-sucking insects that emerged during the summer, but their size was no larger than an average fingertip and could be crushed with ease. However, the \"mosquito\" before him was taller than he was, and he could see individual hairs on its slender limbs. Its long and thin sword-like proboscis pierced in the ground as if it were sucking on something, completely oblivious to the three people standing around it.<br><br>Lying flat on his stomach, Dalmir suddenly felt liquid moving below beneath the soft soil as the giant mosquito's belly swelled up. There was fear in his lowered voice:<br><br>\"Let's escape quickly before it discovers us...\"<br><br>\"Yeah, be careful.\"<br><br>Artem slowed down his breathing and moved slowly through the tall grass. But the nasty creature seemed to detect even the slightest tremor in the soil. In the blink of an eye, it retracted its proboscis and flew into the air. The faint hum came again, accompanied by a numbing headache. Artem brandished the sword that the queen of the Frozen City gave him and readied himself for battle.<br><br>\"Be careful, Artem! It's coming.\"<br><br>The high-pitched noise turned into a shrill scream as the creature approached. Artem parried the piercing attack from the mosquito's mouth with his sword. The creature was agile in the air, able to not only hover but quickly change directions. It flew back into the air and swooped down for another attack. Its movements were so fast that it became a blur. Just as Artem was unable to dodge it, a roar of gunpowder sounded from behind him. The giant mosquito was knocked to the ground, with its legs in the air.<br><br>Artem turned around to see Dalmir holding an ancient flintlock musket, with white smoke coming out of its barrel.<br><br>\"Great shot!\" Dalmir was thrilled with the precision of his shot. But his excitement soon turned into fear as the creature kicked its feet to turn itself over.<br><br>The giant mosquito turned upright and started flying back and forth in the air, enough to make someone dizzy. Artem could tell how angry it was by the fierce flapping of its wings. Its needle-sharp mouth quivered in preparation for its next attack.<br><br>Artem's hand shook as he tried to hold on to the sword. This wasn't going to be an attack that could be dodged by reflexes alone.<br><br>\"Anna, get out of here!\"<br><br>\"But, Artem...\"<br><br>\"Escape? No need.\"<br><br>A strong but powerful voice sounded from out of nowhere. Suddenly, a long lance appeared from the sky and pierced the semi-translucent body of the giant mosquito, pinning it to the ground.<br><br>The battle was over in an instant. Artem let out a sigh of relief. They were saved.<br><br>The man who spoke was dressed in strange imposing attire, looked majestic. What's more surprising was his mount: It was an insect with an armored shell, developed hind legs, and a saddle on its back. It was nearly the size of the giant mosquito that they just fought.<br><br>The insect mount jumped up with lightning-quick speed. As it did, the man pulled his lance from the creature's corpse and stopped in front of Artem. He pointed it with precision at Artem's heart.<br><br>He whistled, and a team of similarly dressed knights appeared from the grasses.<br><br>The three of them were about to express their thanks when the first knight announced:<br><br>\"Strangers trespassing on our sacred land, the Spring Weald.

                "Desc": "<i>Continuation: In this chapter, Artem and friends discovered an altar that can be used to directly communicate with the giant monster \"Spring Weald\" and found out the entrance to its lungs. But what they found when they arrived in its lungs is an Old World rain forest with severe flooding. Artem and Duke dived into the water to find out the reason behind the flooding but was attacked and dragged into the depths...</i><br><br>...<br><br>As Artem slowly woke, a mysterious feeling ran through him, as if he was freed from the weight of his body. He felt light, and the prolonged slumber provided a miraculous sense of security, just as what infants felt when they rest in the water of their mother's womb.<br><br>He slowly regained consciousness but the drowsy feeling remained.<br><br>Artem recalled the last thing that happened before passing out: He struggled to return to the surface as someone was dragging him down deeper into the water. He held out as long as he could before finally running out of air...<br><br>Did I drown?<br><br>There was no time for Artem to figure out what had happened because knowing what was going on was more important: He was completely submerged in water, however, there was not the slightest sense of grasping for air. He turned his wrist and confirmed the flow of water between his fingers. Then, his body began moving upwards as he started kicking his legs.<br><br>\"Bam!\" his back hit the bars of the metal cage.<br><br>The sudden pain made Artem swear out loud, but knowing that he was still alive put his mind at ease.<br><br>\"Are you awake, Mr. Artem?\" A familiar voice came from behind. Artem. Swimming towards the sound, Artem discovered Captain Duke and the iron bars in the water between them.<br><br>\"Captain Duke, you're alive as well? Where are we...\"<br><br>\"We've been captured by the underwater residents.\"<br><br>\"So that's how I passed out...\"<br><br>\"No, you passed out because you were holding your breath. Haven't you noticed? We can breathe in this water.\"<br><br>Artem suddenly understood. He was only alive because of this mysterious water. When he was a medical student, he learned that it was possible to breathe in water if enough oxygen was dissolved.<br><br>It seems their conversation warranted a response from the nearby guard. A boyish figure swam past their cage. Dressed in tights with a harpoon in his hand, he banged hard on the iron bars with the harpoon, producing strong waves that sent Artem back.<br><br>\"Shut up, this isn't a place for chitchat!\" The guard wasn't playing around: \"Where else would you breathe, besides in the water? You fools, come take a look at this.\"<br><br>The guard pulled on the net in his hand. The thing he was dragging floated slowly into sight. There were white transparent sluggish worms. At least Artem thought they were worms, for he had never seen anything like them.<br><br>\"Do you know where these bugs came from?\"<br><br>Artem and Duke looked at each other and shook their heads.<br><br>\"Hmph, useless creatures. I thought you two would know something...\"<br><br>\"...These are bugs?\"<br><br>\"I don't know, but I have to call it something.\" The guard suddenly remembered his position and struck the iron bars again, \"Silence! Don't talk to me!\"<br><br>After a brief moment of silence, Artem asked the guard, \"It doesn't look like it has any internal organs. Maybe it's not a living organism?\"<br><br>\"It chases people as if it has eyes. Who cares if it's living or not,\" snorted the Guard. \"When the body is split open, it releases a liquid that can dissolve people. You also can't breathe in the polluted water.\"<br><br>\"Polluted... water...?\"<br><br>Duke added coldly. \"So, instead of attacking them, you built this huge underwater prison...\"<br><br>\"Hahaha, so you're the clever one. That fool beside you keeps asking stupid questions. Yes, two hundred layers of the prison below you are filled with these bugs.\" The guard's tone suddenly became serious: \"We must continue building the prison to survive.\"<br><br>Artem tried to see the water below him. His eyesight was not as good as Duke's, but he could make out the staggering number of cages beneath him, where countless white bugs were indeed being held. However, the water was so deep that he could not see the bottom, only a deep abyss. The rising waters could have already crushed the insects near the bottom with sheer pressure, leaving only the smell of death in the abyss.<br><br>Artem seemed to understand the real cause behind the flooding in the lungs of \"Spring Weald.\"<br><br>The constant appearance of bugs and the expansion of the prison made the water in its lungs rise higher, leaving less room for oxygen.<br><br>\"This prison wasn't meant for the two of you.\" The guard banged on the iron bars again. \"If you can help us find out where these bugs are coming from, we can let you out of here. How about it?\"<br><br>\"What if I told you we were actually from above the water's surface?\"<br><br>(To Be Continued)"

                "Desc": "<i>Continuation: In this chapter, Artem and friends arrived at the last stop in their voyage — The Lava Kingdom. Loud buzzing noises emerged from the distant lava and boulders responding to Dalmir's signal flares. A gigantic insect suited in plated armor arrives before them. It was their ride to the kingdom of cannons...</i><br><br>...<br><br>Artem originally didn't have any negative feelings towards these invertebrate annelids.<br><br>\"They've noticed the flare. Look, that's the molten insect. It's here to bring us home.\"<br><br>A sense of joy and pride can be noticed in Dalmir's tone.<br><br>\"Here for us? Another gigantic insect... there's too many bugs here.\"<br><br>The gigantic earthworm-like bug stood roughly 2 meters tall and 20 meters long. It continued to squirm as it was parked and waited to be boarded. Numerous layers of petal-shaped scales covered its circular muscles. The scales were coated in a special layer of fine black granite sand which looks to be made of part secretion and part lava.<br><br>Artem was reluctant to board this worm and stood still.<br><br>\"What's wrong, Artem? This is not as strange as the bugs back on the Spring Weald.\"<br><br>\"Let's go, Artem.\"<br><br>Anna followed after Dalmir.<br><br>An old man was standing above the rings of muscle. He was holding a long pole in his hand. In his other hand... was an iron hook, holding onto something like a bridle. He jumped off the back of the giant bug with style. The old man spread out his arms and embraced Dalmir. It was clear that they weren't just acquaintances, but great buddies.<br><br>\"Hey! Dalmir!\"<br><br>\"President Barbicane! You came to see me!\"<br><br>\"Hahahaha, surprised, are you? Quickly, introduce me to your adventure companions!\"<br><br>\"Hello, I'm Anna.\"<br><br>\"Hello, Anna! I'm Barbicane. Hahaha, this girl is adorable!\"<br><br>Barbicane, seeing that Artem hadn't moved, walked towards him, shouting at the top of his voice. \"You, young lad over there! Come quickly. We are heading back to the Lava Kingdom!\"<br><br>Artem, seeing the old man limping over to him and grabbing his hand, reluctantly followed.<br><br>\"...Hello, I'm Artem.\"<br><br>...<br><br>After climbing on the huge molten insect, it was as Artem had feared. The metal armors on its back didn't fit well on the worm. There was nothing Artem could hold onto, except the arms of the seat. He clamped his legs tightly to keep himself from falling off this loose carapace. There was the sound of an electrode at the end of Barbicane's pole, as he looked back at the people seated behind him.<br><br>\"Off we go!\"<br><br>The giant worm squirmed with the shock from Barbicane's pole. With the rhythmic contractions and relaxation of the ringed muscles, the worm moved forward faster and faster. Sitting between Anna and Dalmir, Artem thought this was a marvelous way to travel. The distance between them changed slightly every time the worm's muscles relaxed and contracted.<br><br>Without a doubt, there were some unexpected advantages to this special mode of transportation.<br><br>The large worm and its armor can be compressed to a certain extent, allowing it to crawl through the tunnels. It can go around some smaller volcanic vents, and also climb on rock walls that others would have to circle. Barbicane used complex static signals to control the worm, and the worm made some delicate maneuvers of its own. The two of them were like parts in a well-oiled machine, achieving some impossible movements together<br><br>Artem also noticed the unique way the large worm dissipated heat. A sticky liquid would flow out from the small reticular holes in its armor. The burning sand would then fall off its carapace, while new clay and sand would stick to it from the fresh liquids, thus taking away the heat from the armor.<br><br>\"How incredible...\"<br><br>As the journey continued, Dalmir and Barbicane's conversation about the Lava Kingdom grew more interesting.<br><br>According to Dalmir, half of the adventurers in the Lava Kingdom loved building cannons, while the other half loved adventures. Barbicane is the president of the Lava Kingdom Cannon Development Committee, a fine example of how obsessed they are with cannon technology. The only thing they could boast about was the size of the cannon or its firing range.<br><br>\"In our committee, people respect you based on the might of your cannon. Dalmir is only interested in making flintlocks. We're not interested in that, hahaha!\"<br><br>\"Hey! I'm a professional adventurer! Hahahaha!\"<br><br>President Barbicane's boorish laugh gave everyone around him a sense of kinship. He was missing an eye, and one of his hands and one leg were replaced by metal prosthetics. It wasn't until he turned to talk to Dalmir that Artem noticed part of his skull was also made from some kind of silicon.<br><br>\"What happened to my skull? I lost a chunk of it when the cannon blew up! But it didn't turn me into a slow thinker, haha!\"<br><br>As Artem got used to the bumpy ride, he finally had time to enjoy the sights. There were many volcanoes of varying sizes all looking like they were about to burst. Lava and magma were everywhere, and Artem felt scorching hot just looking at them. Any normal human would think the environment was just too harsh. It wouldn't be completely inaccurate to say this place was hell on earth. The black volcanoes, smoke-filled skies, red lava spewing everywhere... Who would have imagined there'd be a country here focused on the scientific research of cannons?<br><br>\"It's been a long time since any adventurers returned. I've asked our cook to prepare a celebration feast tonight!\"<br><br>Artem was excited that there would be a celebration. Only Anna, who had been watching the volcano in the distance, seemed to be preoccupied with something.<br><br>...<br><br>The banquet hall was full of people from the Cannon Development Committee and the Explorers' Guild. President Barbicane's passionate introduction of the three of them was met with thunderous applause. Artem noticed something: Everyone was missing a body part, whether it be an arm or a leg. Some of them even had a rubber chin or a platinum nose.<br><br>From Artem's perspective, it was a miracle that Dalmir's body was completely intact.<br><br>\"For years now, our Cannon Committee has been planning the greatest cannon event, one that's worthy of our ancestors! Everyone is aware that the greatest volcanic activity in history is coming!\"<br><br>\"Viva the volcanoes!\" The banquet hall filled up with loud cheers once more.<br><br>\"We will bravely shoot ourselves into outer space, risking our lives for the greatest adventure the world has ever known!\"<br><br>\"Viva the outer space!\" The whole banquet hall shook as if it would collapse at any moment.<br><br>\"Positional observations from Dalmir's journey have allowed us to track the Satelleden. I am pleased to announce that we can now reach it with complete certainty using cannon!\"<br><br>Many people were shocked at the announcement, evident by the sudden silence in the hall. Then, it was followed by cheering and applause that couldn't be suppressed, even if all the cannons in the banquet hall were fired at once.<br><br>Artem sneaked away from the crowd of people in the banquet hall. He saw Anna looking out of the window at the quiet volcano in the distance. Besides her, it was the sparkling wine they had brought from the Spring Weald.<br><br>\"Anna...\"<br><br>\"Artem, don't say anything. Can you come here for a moment?\"<br><br>During their adventures, Artem had witnessed Anna's extraordinary tenacity a thousand times. But now, her voice sounded like a distress signal, pleading to him for help. Her soft breathes seemed to be conveying a desire to make him stay. It made Artem want to embrace her from behind.<br><br>\"What's wrong?\"<br><br>\"If you go to outer space, will you ever come back again...?\"<br><br>\"Perhaps, there probably won't be volcano cannons in the Satelleden.\"<br><br>\"Artem...\" Anna turned around and her face flushed as if she had cried. At that moment, the sounds from the banquet hall faded away and the whole world fell silent.<br><br>\"I miss home. Will you come home with me?\"<br><br><br>(To Be Continued)"

After hearing the kind speech of the president of the Lava Kingdom Cannon Development Committee, Barbicane, they realized that their arduous journey was nearing its end, but Anna wanted to quit and wished Artem could stay as well...</i><br><br>...<br><br>Dalmir was confused, but he didn't dare ask any questions.<br><br>There was a delicate feeling in the air between Artem and Anna by the second day of the celebration.<br><br>Dalmir speculated that Artem saw the uplifted feelings of the festival as an opportunity and confessed his love for Anna, but was ultimately turned down. He had always believed the two would end up together, but reality has shown him how naive he was. If he had been launched from the cannons and seen more of the world, maybe he would've seen it coming.<br><br>\"Umm... I brought you guys to the launching grounds here today to show you our pride, the volcano cannon.\"<br><br>Dalmir was aware that the two were not in a good mood, but he thought that it would be best not to ask.<br><br>\"As I've said before, the energy of the volcano is the energy of the planet itself.\"<br><br>\"The core of the planet is always pushing towards the opposite direction of gravity and not sitting at the center of this planet. This enormous outward compression force shoots out the lava and other gases from beneath the ground. This is the power of the volcano...\"<br><br>Artem and Anna looked upon the distant lava in the main volcano through the thick glass.<br><br>Its characteristics were similar to ocean waves, rising and falling. On the other hand, it was like boiling water, with gases constantly pushing out of the magma and forming bubbles that soon bursted. The scorching temperatures heated the air unevenly and caused heat hazes to appear. Anyone could see that such an unstable, burning, and bright liquid could not be suppressed for much longer.<br><br>Without realizing it, Artem was sweating all over.<br><br>\"Instability, unpredictability, and too much power were all reasons that humans in the past could not harness this energy. However, our ancestors changed their mind during the Ice Age.\"<br><br>\"Don't try to control it. Set it free!\"<br><br>\"You're right, Artem! We should just set this immense energy free, like...\"<br><br>They said in unison, \"Like one big fart!\"<br><br>The two of them laughed. Dalmir had told many cheesy jokes like this during their journey.<br><br>It wasn't until they were staring at the ready-to-erupt volcano that the foolish explanations came to life. It was unbelievable that they are standing so close to such outlandish descriptions. Artem feels like he's still in a dream.<br><br>Anna laughed lightly as she walked behind them.<br><br>\"The energy container at the top, and the volcanic accelerators over there... They're expensive to make, but they are all disposable...\"<br><br>Dalmir suddenly stopped. He wasn't pleased with that expression.<br><br>\"They've prepared their whole lives for the one battle, but it only takes one battle to prove everything. They aren't disposables! They're the ultimate romanticists!\"<br><br>\"...Romanticists...?\"<br><br>Artem felt as if something was stirring inside his chest like restless magma. As Dalmir's voice grew quieter, he could feel the vibrations of the mantle, all that immense energy to realize the once-in-a-lifetime romance.<br><br>\"Look over here! This is the cannonball we'll be riding in!\"<br><br>It was a spherical cockpit about seven meters in diameter, with wide windows in front. There were countless precise instruments, levers, and buttons inside. On the outside, there were a pair of thin wings that could open out...<br><br>It didn't look like anything from the Lava Kingdom.<br><br>\"Could it be...\"<br><br>\"That's right. It was a cannonball created by the people from the Old World. This is the only one in the whole world!\"<br><br>The outside was covered with material that can withstand temperatures up to 5000 degrees Celsius. Telemetry communications, energy, temperature control, and other precision equipment lined the walls of the interior. Artem had unearthed many Old World relics to know immediately that this was the pinnacle of Old World technology, something that could take people to outer space for real.<br><br>\"This cannonball is also a romanticist, flying into outer space with no return. It will complete its mission during the journey, then float through the universe as a permanent fixture...\"<br><br>Once again, Artem felt he was no longer on the ground. He was among the brilliant stars that filled the night sky.<br><br>Anna looked at the man standing before her, knowing that his mind had already left this planet.<br><br>She understood completely. Artem's heart had reached the heights of the firmament that she couldn't reach, no matter hard she tried. It was far, far beyond the Satelleden, far beyond the end of the universe. And so, she decided to leave quietly before dawn. Perhaps it would make him less miserable.<br><br>...<br><br>But she still couldn't do it.<br><br>\"Thank you, Anna.\"<br><br>On the path before sunrise, she saw a clear silhouette — It was Artem, waiting for her. She couldn't leave quietly after all.<br><br>\"I have been deeply in love with you ever since you saved my life. I have never seen such a tenacious, independent, and gentle woman like you. There were plenty of chances for me to tell you: I like you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\"<br><br>\"But I cannot stay with you. If there's one thing that I must do in life, it is to go on adventures, continuous adventures. I'm sorry...\"<br><br>\"I think I'm also a romanticist. I'm willing to risk everything I have for the sake of adventure. I'm sorry...\"<br><br>With tears in her eyes, Anna knew.<br><br>She knew the moment she embarked on this journey. It was the kind of man she fell in love with.<br><br>Before her tears could fall, a warm hand wiped away her tears. It was Artem's hand, which she knew too well.<br><br>\"I don't want you to shed so many tears for me. But I've already decided...\"<br><br>\"I understand. I understand completely...\"<br><br>\"I can only give you three things.\"<br><br>Artem took out his journal, which carefully recorded all his adventures and memories with Anna.<br><br>\"The first is my past. Everything we experienced together was real.\"<br><br>Artem placed the sword that the Frozen City Queen had given him in Anna's hands.<br><br>\"The second is my future. This is my promise to the queen. I wish to protect you forever.\"<br><br>\"And the last is my present.

Is this really going to be okay? From the inside, Artem and Dalmir had to withstand 10 g's of crushing force. They were almost smashed by the power.<br><br>Artem lost consciousness the split-second upon launch and the memories of the dangers on the Snow Plains appeared in his mind. His lulled state did not last long as he woke himself up with impressive conviction and mental discipline. After experiencing the near-death moment, Artem immediately noticed the importance of the shock-reduction capacitor in the flying pod. Without it, he'd already be dead.<br><br>Dalmir on the other hand was having a much harder time. His eyes were rolled back and white foam was coming out of his slightly opened mouth. Is he passed out? Or is he... gone? Artem called for him over the radio several times, but Dalmir did not respond.<br><br>Not only could the approaching space be seen in the porthole of the \"cannonball,\" but so could the distancing ground from beneath.<br><br>The spectacular view unfolds rapidly in front of Artem's eyes. The familiar sights quickly shrink till it becomes unfamiliar. The numbers on the instruments continue to climb, with no sign of slowing down whatsoever.<br><br>Artem was still unaware of what was happening even though everything pointed towards the same conclusion — They were leaving the planet at shocking speeds.<br><br>— They were 5000 meters off the ground.<br><br>Artem could still see the buildings of the Lava Kingdom, especially the main cannon that fired the \"cannonball.\"<br><br>The launch caused a massive landslide, reducing the main volcano to a billowing cloud of smoke. At this height, the large molten insects were impossible to see and the lava on the ridges looked like a spider silk web. The bright colors that scorched the eyes had softened considerably.<br><br>The volcanic ash in the air sped by quickly, as the ground slowly became a blur.<br><br>— 10,000 meters off the ground.<br><br>Artem could see the Spring Weald.<br><br>At the height of tens of thousands of meters, Artem could barely see the back of the beast. Even so, he had not seen the monster's entire body! Such a giant beast! It was an indescribable feeling to have a panoramic view of the roads he had taken on during his long adventures.<br><br>Artem traced the route he had once taken on, saw through the snowy mountains, and looked at the blizzard. The Frozen City was within the quickly passing clouds and snow, and he could barely see its outline.<br><br>Anna once said she would go fishing with her father to relax at the end of long adventures. How would she relax this time...<br><br>Thin clouds began to obstruct his view and thoughts of escaping came back. How long has the \"cannonball\" been flying...<br><br>— They flew higher until they reached the darkness.<br><br>Belobog loomed over the dark land.<br><br>Thousands of lit houses were only the size of a coin, but Artem knew that it was Belobog. The urban heat island effect stood out against the surrounding chill, which was more evident when looking down from the clouds. It was this warmth that had sustained Belobog for a hundred years, but it also prevented its people from going outside.<br><br>Compared to the size of the planet, Belobog was but a speck of dirt. Artem once thought that Belobog and its surroundings was the entire world. Thinking back now, it was just the unwillingness to admit his narrow perspective.<br><br>At this height, anyone would agree that such a narrow perspective was laughable.<br><br>— 100,000 meters off the ground.<br><br>Artem could clearly see the curvature of the planet.<br><br>The great auroras started appearing. The brilliant ribbons gently covered the surface of the planet. Back in Belobog, Artem had gazed up at these dreamlike veils fluttering in the night sky. Now, they were below him.<br><br>It was at this moment that static came through the communication device...<br><br>\"...A—Artem! We! Ahhhh! Are in the sky! Ahhhhh... Ahhh...\"<br><br>It was Dalmir's screaming from earlier.<br><br>Artem really didn't know whether to laugh or cry.<br><br>...<br><br>— 400,000 meters off the ground. Artem could see the Satelleden.<br><br>It was a large cylindrical object, rotating slowly. Artem had heard of science fantasies that the effects of gravity could be simulated through rotating centrifugal force. He brushed it off as mere fantasy until witnessing the miracle before his eyes. The excitement was overwhelming.<br><br>I wonder how people from the Old World will react when they see this \"cannonball.\" Fear? Surprise? Will they be treated like invaders and face retaliation?<br><br>Soft music began playing in the \"cannonball.\" It was a mix of drums and guitars that make you feel warm and cozy, like a gift at the end of their journey:<br><br><i>\"Distant cosmic radio is calling\"</i><br><br><i>\"Distant cosmic radio is calling\"</i><br><br>...<br><br>As the \"cannonball\" got closer, Artem could make out more details of the Satelleden.<br><br>If the interior was spread out, \"Satelleden\" would be a large rectangular area. The opposite sides of the area would join to form the cylinder. Anywhere you stood, you could raise your head and see the streets hanging above.<br><br>In the streets, many buildings violated physics. The mechanical giants appeared to be connecting the building blocks by combining various modules. Neatly planned streets kept adjusting their positions. To Artem, the whole \"city\" was breathing and pulsing like a living organism and rotating as a Rubik's Cube. It was constantly evolving, showing ultimate rationality. As an immaculate work of art that had long been abandoned, \"Satelleden\" was floating alone in the universe, awaiting the gaze of human admiration.<br><br>As if sensing the \"cannonball,\" the large object extended a docking port of the same astonishing proportions, like a giant extending its hand at a flying insect. Artem's heart clenched out of fear that the last moments of his journey would end in a fiery collision.<br><br>But the disaster he imagined didn't happen The docking port gently held the \"cannonball\" and guided it to the landing pad in Satelleden.<br><br>The music was still playing gently on their communication devices...<br><br>...<br><br><i>\"I climb the ladder to the stars\"</i><br><br><i>\"And walk in the gallery of outer space\"</i><br><br><i>\"Insomnia awaits the Cosmos tonight\"</i><br><br>..."

                "Desc": "Chapter 3: Intelligentsia Guild<br><br>The universe is vast and without bounds, and Erudition encompasses countless. Geniuses have their own ways with words as the ordinaries have their own self-satisfactions. Aside from the Genius Society, whose pool of extraordinary talents merited them a personal acknowledgement from Nous, there is another organization that is motivated by Erudition and tirelessly continues its studies and research known as the Intelligentsia Guild.<br><br>All personal bias aside, the hard work of the Intelligentsia Guild deserves a degree of respect. Nous's club is filled with weirdos, lunatics, lone wolves, anti-social geniuses, and outcasts. Though they continuously produced astonishing findings, they never share this knowledge with the outside world, let alone publish it. <s>(With this book as an exception).</s> The philosophy of the Intelligentsia Guild is to instead communicate and share: Knowledge is a type of hard currency, and miracles are only brought about when currency is in circulation. As such, they exchange knowledge for wisdom and formulas for recipes. The IPC accepted and sponsored them in a very generous fashion, lending them the near-infinite powers of the IPC and the technology to move across worlds. The scholars traverse across many worlds and collect all valuable knowledge, turning it into a commodity.<br><br>The Intelligentsia Guild is more like a commerce group when compared to ordinary researchers. Their structure is built upon basic individual organizations of \"schools,\" each responsible for their own earnings and expenses. The scholars would research and trade the knowledge they've acquired in their area of expertise, trying to obtain truly priceless treasures this way. The following are a few more renowned schools for the reader's perusal:<br><br> -Synesthesia School-<br><br>The Synesthesia School is undoubtedly the school that has made the greatest contribution to the cosmos. For a very long time, communication has been a critical issue that has troubled the IPC. The foundation of any trade is its contract. However, the drafting of a contract requires mutual acknowledgment of its terms and there is a long and complicated list of languages spoken by intellectual lifeforms. The researchers of Synesthesia School worked to build a common thought bridge between the different species known as the Synesthesia Beacon that's widely used today.<br><br>Thanks to the Synesthesia Beacon, all body movements, flash signals, sound vibrations, or the change in odor molecules — any sort of signal that holds meaning will be converted into a thought pulse and translated into a comprehensible language. The first obstacle of communication has been overcome. The IPC used the Synesthesia Beacon as the foundation and built a giant database, storing the speech and vocabulary of almost a hundred million languages. Inscriptions are no longer a mystery.<br><br>It is said that the IPC is still paying the Synesthesia School a hefty licensing fee each quarter. This school has the wealth of a nation. A reliable contact has informed the writer that the next research topic of the Synesthesia School will be long-distance communication via ultraremote sensing technology. This technology was already invented by Elias Salas, member #56 of the Genius Society, and put into the use of the Genius Society over six hundred Amber Eras ago. But of course, the geniuses encourage the average Joe to continue to develop their own erudition.<br><br> -Astral Ecology School-<br><br>This school views the cosmos as a large ecological observation subject. They are obsessed with studying the void song whale, luminescent jellyfish, and other organisms of the cosmos. The school earned its recognition for the discovery of the Celestial Comet Wall. The IPC was exhilarated to hear the confirmation that this was an ancient creation of Qlipoth, Aeon of Preservation. They paid the school an incredibly large sum of money, once again proving the old saying of \"work smart, not hard\" to be correct.<br><br> -Candelagraphos-<br><br>The Candelagraphos is the printing department of the guild. They are made of countless authors, transcribers, typists, programmers, and workers who produce books. This school is founded upon the noble gesture of altruism, surrendering selfish scientific research and throwing themselves at the grand service of sharing wisdom with more people. The science of the Intelligentsia Guild is gathered here and organized into books to be published and sold to all the worlds. The most famous series is definitely the Traveler's Guide.<br><br> -Armed Archaeologists-<br><br>This is a school passionate about cosmic exploration and archaeology. They are always heading to the most desolate planets and exploring the most dangerous ruins. Try to imagine a group of scholars armed to the teeth leading a dozen mercenaries out of an exploration vessel and crawling in and out of the crevices of ancient buildings that have been forgotten for countless Amber Eras. They would leave behind the few fools that accidentally triggered various traps as an offering. Upon reaching their destination, they would dig up valuable artifacts and ancient writing before calmly laying down explosives and opening a path made from total destruction. They would then happily board their ship and leave... Some say they look more to be mercenaries than scholars, but that's up to each person to interpret.<br><br> -Quantum History School-<br><br>This is a new school reformed from the bankrupted Psychology History School. Its original purpose is to find the influences of disturbance and patterns of change hidden throughout history, and then make predictions for the future. However, they've become a group of scammers that use a series of complex \"calculations\" for fortune-telling. The reason I've included this school is to wrap up this interesting piece of writing with a funny joke."

                "Desc": "Chapter <s>263</s>4: Interastral Peace Corporation<br><br>Qlipoth, the Amber Lord — a colossal statue without a head. Silent and oblivious, THEY only think about constructing THEIR mysterious and giant wall. What was it for? No one knows. What is it THEY're trying to keep out? No one knows. Most normal people will ignore it after realizing our ignorance, but there are always abnormal people in this world. There are two different types even in that group. One type thinks that: \"Wow, there's a God building a wall — this means walls are sacred — so we're going to build walls too!\" What kind of ridiculous logic is this? And with that, this group of people believes they've received some sort of revelation and began wasting precious resources to build useless things on their respective planets. These people are known as the Architects. As for the other group, well, they're even dumber than the Architects. Although the Architects have a few screws loose in their heads, they're at least thinking about doing things that are beneficial to themselves. On the contrary, the other group of people think that: \"Wow, there's a God building a wall — this means walls are sacred — so we have to help God build walls!\" — Whaa?<br><br>And with that, a group of people filled with a self-sacrificing mentality gathered and formed a support team for Qlipoth. Knowing that they're not exactly capable of doing anything, this support team used the power of Paths and flew to different worlds to source the various materials needed for building a wall as a tribute to the God. At this very moment, two intelligent individuals emerged from this group of imbeciles and changed the destiny of the entire cosmos.<br><br>And now, the writer will explain the events to follow in detail.<br><br>First, the support team flew to an unfamiliar planet. They were lucky to find the planet inhabited by a friendly race who received them warmly. The support team said: \"Respected companions of the cosmos! The universe is facing destruction and our Aeon is building a wall spanning across light-years to protect the cosmos. We urge you to take part and join in on the construction!\"<br><br>The aliens reply, smiling: \"Wow, that sounds extraordinary. What can we do to help?\"<br><br>The support team says: \"We need wood, stone, rebars, cement, titanium... anything and everything that can be used in construction, we want them all.\"<br><br>The aliens reply: \"Good, we have a lot of those materials. What will you use to trade for them?\"<br><br>And this is when the first landmark of economics was born: The trade of resources—<br><br>The support team says: \"Oh, we have a lot of wood, stone, rebars, cement, titanium... anything and everything that can be used to build stuff, we have it all.\"<br><br>The alien replies: \"This kind of trade would be pointless.\"<br><br>And this is when the wise ones take the stage. Today, both of their names are inscribed into each wall and ceiling panel in the IPC: Louis Fleming and Dongfang Qixing. The wise ones quickly answer: \"There is a planet called Clementine three systems from here. It has a local specialty called winter sun fruit that is incredibly delicious and melts in your mouth.\" The two upsold the berry as if it were something that fell out of heaven.<br><br>The alien replies: \"Wow, that sounds amazing. Okay, five hundred kilograms of wood for five hundred kilograms of winter sun fruit.\"<br><br>And this is when resource gained a quantitative value —<br><br>\"Winter sun fruits are extremely precious.\" Wise man number one Louis Fleming says, \"An entire Amber Era wouldn't yield five hundred kilograms of it! On the contrary, five hundred kilograms of wood means very little to you. How about this, we'll trade five kilograms of winter sun fruit for your five hundred kilograms of wood. I guarantee you'll love it!\"<br><br>Dear readers, this conversation took place nearly 800 Amber Eras ago. I'm sure you can tell that wise man number one was being completely dishonest. Though winter sun fruits may be delicious, it is nowhere near as rare as he described it to be. The wise man was lying. He was able to do this because he had the ultimate advantage of asymmetric information. Once one party has more information than the other, then they will gain the absolute initiative. When applied to this specific incident, it meant that wise man number one possessed the power to set prices.<br><br>And with that, things start to develop in a positive direction: The support team realized that they need to provide and trade with merchandise that the other party is interested in for them to get the resources that they want. The support team no longer purchases only construction materials but start to buy food, drinks, clothes, and everyday goods... They bought everything that other planets would be interested in. The more business they did, the bigger their business grew. Intellect number two Dongfang Qixing realized something: If they're the only people in the entire cosmos that are in the trade business, then it's time for them to set their own rules.<br><br>— And with that, the galactic currency was born —<br><br>More than seven hundred and seventy Amber Eras ago, Louis Fleming and Dongfang Qixing announced the reformation of the support team and started the Interastral Peace Corporation (IPC). At the same moment, the IPC introduced the universal galactic currency: Credits. Ever since that day, the people of each planet never had to worry about how much they could trade for their local specialties — everything already had a price tag attached to it! They would receive credits from the IPC and use the credits to purchase merchandise from the IPC. The market is no longer comprised of three parties with the IPC in the middle. Now, people can purchase goods directly from the IPC. Although the sellers and buyers didn't change much, this actually forms a great advantage for the IPC.<br><br>The buyer and seller asset movement seems to have come to a halt.<br><br>— Halted asset means that there are now deposit capital —<br><br>Assets valued in the trillions have suddenly become hidden behind the IPC's credits and immediately filled the IPC's pockets, but the IPC has bottomless pockets! And just like that, the IPC turned from being just a small organization sourcing materials for an Aeon to the strongest force in the entire cosmos.<br><br>However, it is worth mentioning that even after having made such a great accomplishment, the IPC never forgot why the organization was put together in the first place. The construction materials the IPC has accumulated over nearly 800 Amber Eras are now piled across each planet surrounding the Aeon Qlipoth. The Aeon has never uttered a word about their actions, nor made any use of their offerings. Even so, the IPC's outlook remains unwavering:<br><br>This is what you call faith."

It's a request from the IPC.\"<br><br>To be honest, I've never thought about this before. The Genius Society has its own rules and rarely ever shares anything with the outside world. Actually, why should we care about what happens to the universe? Our research and discoveries make us happy, and that's more than enough. Even if the cosmos were to go into all-out war, we would be able to take care of ourselves with our abilities — however, judging from a different perspective... What harm could it do even if I were to write a book? None that I could think of. In fact, I'm not the only one who's thought of publishing in the history of the Genius Society. Zandar, member #1 of the Genius Society, wrote a book before. Aiden, member #22 and inventor of the nine-worded formulae, also wrote a book. To my knowledge, Screwllum, member #76, also wrote a booklet a few Amber Eras ago to educate its butler on the maintenance of a large computer management system. Besides, the great Nous the Erudition also stored all the information within THEIR body. Isn't this also a form of writing? Having thought of all this, I feel it would not be a bad thing to actually sit down and write a book of my own.<br><br>The IPC sent someone last week to deliver the down payment for the book. I was shocked to see the number of zeros on it. I began to think seriously about writing. First, I need to explain the content of this book within this Preface: It will not contain any of my groundbreaking discoveries, nor will it have intrinsic mathematic deductions — though I am famous for the above, I wish to display my true self here. Truth be told, I want to write a book about the universe, Aeons, factions, and everything else. I have had more frequent interactions with other worlds in the past Amber Eras. I began to work with the IPC, assisted Xianzhou in their battle against the abominations, got my hands on numerous collections from the Astral Express, and stirred up some trouble with the Garden of Recollection. I've been more active recently than I have been ever before. I've noticed that the truly interesting things in the universe aren't its cold laws and rules, but the Aeons formed of highly condensed philosophy and the foolish conniving humans gathering around the Aeons. This is what I want to write: The lonesome gods and their insouciant followers. I hope the readers will find the book satisfying.<br><br>Thank you IPC for your sponsorship."

Is it the mysterious and unknown Device IX? Is it the Nameless that perished alongside Akivili? Or is it the Beyond the Sky Choir that only exists in legends? None of the above. In truth, the most mysterious, supernatural, and nebulous organization is the one that the author of this book belongs to: The \"Genius Society\" favored by the Aeon Nous.<br><br>Firstly, let us state a universal truth: The author is a super genius of the kind only born once every few millennia, even on the scale of the entire universe. To reiterate, the author is not shameless, but shame means nothing to the author — The author had solved the solitary waves theory and the Spark model hypothesis at a very young age. As a young adult, the author discovered the conversion method for Sigma Baryons. The author proposed the Herta sequence and published a paper on reversed-progeria in middle age, and managed to conduct reversed-progeria in old age. In their regained youth, the author once again solved the secret behind the Imaginary leakage phenomenon, and captured and sealed the Stellaron from beyond the sky. The author had saved the planet they were on from total destruction for a total of nineteen times and has met the Aeons twice. The above is but a fraction of the author's innumerable accomplishments. Invitations to join the Genius Society are only handed out to individuals as rare as the author, and there have only been 84 of such illustrious members since the birth of Nous. Therefore, on the above evidence, the author deems the Genius Society as the most mysterious. In this book, for the first time ever, the enigmatic veil of the Genius Society will be lifted for the readers.<br><br>(The draft ends here abruptly. Words are scribbled below:<br><i>The people of this stupid society don't communicate with each other at all. What am I supposed to write about?</i><br>An unfamiliar handwriting follows:<br><i>Deary, you have to write something.

Just as even the best captain can't drive a sinking ship through a storm, the genius Hosea Lazaro faces unprecedented injustice on the space station. It's all because we don't have the financial power of a scalper, the diplomatic capacity of a politician, the multiracial support of a biologist, or the divine favor of a fortune-teller.<br><br>All we have is an infinite yearning for the uncultivated lands within the cosmos and hands that dig deep into the earth.<br><br>However, those who want nothing more but to watch as Hosea Lazaro embarrasses himself will be disappointed!

Join the Adventurous Moles and put your knowledge and courage to the test with Becky, Carbine, and Pava as you become the fourth little mole. The book is divided into four parts, each with its own unique story, and a riddle will appear at the end of each part for you to solve.<br><br>The adventure this time is different from The Moles' past visits to distant jungles, icy mountains, and temple ruins. The backdrop of this story is a place all of our little moles are familiar with — Belobog. During this adventure, a group of archaeologists have uncovered the will left by Drake, the great adventurer of Belobog, in which he stated:<br><br><i>\"I've enjoyed almost 50 years of adventures and have been to almost every destination in and out of Belobog. Along the way, I've collected a plethora of exotic treasures. Some of which I donated to the Belobog Museum, while the most dangerous and enigmatic of which I have hidden. The treasure's location was drawn on a treasure map, which was then divided into many pieces and placed in 'invisible treasure chests.' Only the person who finds all of the treasure chests will then be able to find my treasure.\"</i><br><br>This time in The Adventurous Moles, it's up to you, our fourth little mole, to find all the pieces of the story. <color=#f29e38ff>If you follow the hints on the list, they will lead you to the correct locations, where you will be able to gather the book pages. The pages conceal clues to the riddles that will lead you to the invisible treasure chests... </color>By collecting all the pages, not only will you complete a copy of <i>The Adventurous Moles: Hidden Treasure</i>, but you will also discover Drake the Great Adventurer's treasure.<br><br>Every clue in the story may hold the key to understanding the riddle, so think carefully and don't dismiss any clues. Don't be concerned if your acute mind briefly fails you. As long as you follow your intuition, you will find the answer. We have also prepared several helpful resources for the adventure, which are printed at the end of the book for your convenience.<br><br>Are you ready to embark on an exciting adventure, little moles?"

I truly don't comprehend collectors' tastes like yours.\" Pava scratched his curly hair. \"I still have the limited Silvermane Guard festival edition of this flask at home, which I can sell to you for a low price.\"<br><br>The Moles paid, collected the antique flask, and exited the room. A continuous flow of people passed by the outdoor café. There had been an antique craze since the archaeological team made the Great Adventurer Drake's will public, and everyone was hunting for clues to the 'invisible treasure chests.' It also irritated Carbine, an antique collector whose pastime had gotten more expensive.<br><br>\"Look what I found in this kettle! A piece of parchment!\" Becky opened the kettle. \"No way.

Just a few days ago, they were eating suncakes and talking about how to spend the holiday. Now, they were involved in an unexpected conspiracy. Why did those who attended the gathering want the treasure? Where was Drake's underground hidden door? And what would they do to Pava... She couldn't answer any of these questions.<br><br>\"Hold on.\" Becky picked up a piece of paper. It looked like something used by the school they went to, which meant it was left by Pava. \"There's nothing on the paper, and it's sticky.\"<br><br>\"Sticky? It might be Pava's invisible ink.\" Carbine recalled the small things he made in the secret base, and how he used invisible ink to write things down. If the text was written with brine, you heat the paper. If it was written with white candle, use charcoal powder to make the text visible... \"Let me have a go!\"<br><br>And sure enough, the piece of paper carried secret information.

It's been five hours and I can still clearly feel the sensation of the traction cable tightly wrapped around my upper body. Even though I am aware that the cable is made from a rare lithium fluoride that can't be damaged by even the sharpest blade, I still imagine myself being unbound and slowly floating into space. After all, the universe is vast and there is definitely a place for everyone. What's the point of staying on the space station and being constantly humiliated? Maybe I would be lucky enough to be intercepted by the Celestial Comet Wall while floating through the darkness and board the jingling mine cart of the shepherds to travel amongst the stars. But it is also possible that I would fall right through the cracks of the cosmos into the great abyss of the Leviathan like a mayfly into the mouth of a giant whale.<br><br>Are their insides warm, dark, and moist?

It didn't matter, because soon the monsters will be arriving, and they will throw themselves at the space station more frequently than they have in the past. The mutations they will send will also be more horrifying. They've been kept in the Research Cabin for the past era and living as phantoms in the rumors that spread across the space station. But now, being in the frontlines, it is very likely I will encounter them eventually.<br><br>This isn't exactly bad news. In fact, it makes me excited. Information regarding the Legion has always been monopolized by the elite researchers. It would be much more interesting to observe the space station's most prominent enemy up close than inspecting and repairing ionization balance, and researching for ways to upgrade the defenses. Why would upgrading defenses be something a researcher like me should be worrying about? Does the IPC only make the defenses and offer no after-sales services? Leaving the task of ultimate survival to the researcher with the lowest evaluation score in an era doesn't make sense at all. I suspect that this is just a trap and that there is a subtext to it: Once a researcher fails, he should go and do some physical labor to prove what value they have remaining.<br><br>Although I have no interest in this topic, I have to produce a decent research report or I'll have to continue my stare down with it in the next era. It's a spectacular form of cyclical punishment.<br><br>I actually don't really understand why everything has a score. Obviously, someone's gonna say only a bottom-feeder and failure like me would question the logical nature of a point system. All the researchers line up to enter the Scoring Room on the same day of every system year, allowing the space station to inspect us in the name of Erudition. Like pigs for the slaughter on an assembly line, we are branded with elite, average, or inferior scores. For the purpose of receiving a higher score, topics that are less popular, more esoteric, or have a longer reporting period are deserted by the researchers, while the number of research topics that are for flattery and show increase by the day. I understood something when I looked at the researchers pursuing that artificial score: We are not being blessed by the Erudition, but exploited by it. It can easily control this crowd of intelligent minds, placing their unrestrained ingenuity in one specific location, thus annihilating all possibilities for them to think freely.<br><br>I can't help but think about the situation on my home planet, the one marked Xin-41 on the Hosea Star Map. Back then, I was such a genius, and with so much energy. When I first showed the potential to take the test, my childhood companions were no different from the shallow researchers at the space station. They had surrounded and cheered for me, just like how the researchers are now celebrating the \"heroes\" researching the Legion. They had prayed that I would one day take them away from Xin-41, that one day I would show the residents of Xin-41 what life is like in segmenta outside of the colonized area. They've once dreamed of a different life, one that doesn't include wasting their entire lives harvesting hallucinogenic spices to sustain the Slinkan species' supposed dreams of immortality.<br><br>I, too, only found out after arriving at the space station that the Slinkans aren't the rulers of the cosmos. On the contrary, compared to the supreme existences in this cosmos, the Slinkans are really not that different from the residents of Xin-41. If the residents of Xin-41 were brave enough, they should revolt at all costs against the weak social control the Slinkans have over them. But they can't, because they lack both knowledge and courage.<br><br>Although I've overcome my lack of knowledge regarding these oppressive situations, the cowardice bred from the impoverished soil on Xin-41 has been etched deep into my bones. That was why I remained silent when I received my single-digit score due to those unpredictable spiritual organisms. I received the gaze of the \"Skynet\" in the Scoring Room, just as I had bathed under the acid rain of my home planet. I was burning up. I was humiliated. I was full of hatred — and I was silent.<br><br>However, it's proven that even the feeling of awkwardness is unnecessary. There is only one benefit in splitting people into different grades outside of the space station — the convenience of feeling superior to others. It is worse here, however. The researchers have no need for something like a sense of superiority. All their hard work is for the purpose of gaining Madam Herta's attention and acknowledgment. They walk past me as if I'm just a harmless ghost. That's right. There have always been harmless ghosts wandering around aimlessly in silence here. It's just that by the time I became able and willing to notice them, I too had become one of them.<br><br>I still haven't found the courage to tell my real situation to my family in the distant homeland. I don't want them to know that the genius of Xin-41, whom they had such high hopes for, is nothing but an inferior-grade pig in the space station they gaze upon day and night.<br><br>Eikura Shuu"

In this flood of time and life, the only treasure is the memory that proves the existence of people.<br><br>Memokeepers from the Garden of Recollection are dedicated to preserving and sharing memories. Enlightened by their master Fuli, Memokeepers shed their mortal flesh and live on as memetic entities. With this unique gift, they can freely traverse between worlds, unconstrained by physical limits. Memokeepers often disguise themselves as natives of the worlds they visit. They trade, copy, steal, deceive... using every means necessary to collect precious memories."

It made him so happy that he lit a Harmonious Joy that he has saved for many years to celebrate. I couldn't stop him. You know what I'm talking about. Ever since the Slinkans announced the ban on spices, all related products have been removed from our daily lives. Your dad is risking being arrested and physical punishment to celebrate. He even showed the entire town your letter. Please understand that he's not trying to breach our family's privacy. It's just that he's genuinely proud of having you as his son.<br><br>That night, everyone bunched together to read your letter. The Curio in the space station that you mentioned is something unheard-of here. And the descriptions of the researchers you work with, heh, well, to people like us who have spent their entire lives on Xin-41, they sound like geniuses compared to even the Slinkans. However, according to what you said in your letter, the Slinkans aren't the embodiment of the truth nor the dominion of the universe. Then does that mean they aren't able to bring our civilization to its apex? Are there really more majestic beings than the Slinkans? To be honest, this is all a little too much for me. I tried looking through historical records in the pile of dusty books about the period before the Slinkans arrived but was stopped by your father. He said that the only reason I would attempt to do something as risky as reading banned books is that I had nothing better to do. I was about to use your words to talk back to him, but he said that if I had the time for that, I'm better off gathering another basket of leaves from the spice fields so that we would have enough money to send you a few more things from home next harvest season. I thought about it. Your father was right. These things are better left to you young people to think about. Oh, and there was a boy who got really excited reading your letter. His name is Milo, and he used to attend the same academy as you.<br><br>Let me think... He stood on a chair and said you have brought brand-new knowledge to everyone. He said that you were... the fire bringer... or something. He quickly left after saying that. At the time I'm writing this letter, he has already been missing for twenty-two days. And today, in the foggy morning, his body was discovered. The morning fog has been very thick recently on Xin-41. I think it's because the Slinkans have increased the burning of spices. I think they're celebrating some sort of holiday or welcoming someone important. A number of small spacecrafts flew frequently around the Slinkan Residential Area. But I digress. Back to Milo. He was lying in the wilderness a hundred meters from the Slinkan Residential Area. His eyes, mouth, ears, and abdomen were stuffed full with used spices. The townspeople all said this is a warning from the Slinkans. We buried Milo on a small hill, on the side where the dark yellow lilacs blossom. A few people cried, including your father. They loudly denounced the thick smoke and how it makes their eyes hurt, but quietly claim that Milo's individualistic style cost him his life. If he had an idea, he should've talked to everyone about it. They also said that he was stubborn like a pair of fire tongs, and didn't rat anyone out till his death. Don't worry, after what had happened, I won't ever let your dad carelessly share your letters again.<br><br>Oh, I've also got something that's been bothering everyone. Aren't you working at Herta Space Station? Then what does Madam Herta mean? Is that a person? From your descriptions, she sounds like a Slinkan. Intelligent, wealthy, cold, and a little crazy. You've dealt with Slinkans on Xin-41 for more than a decade, so it's no surprise you were able to earn her favor. Obviously, I'm not saying that your work isn't just as splendid. I believe that getting number one in your evaluation is a result of an immense amount of hard work. But then again, you've already proven you were capable of that when you first passed the exam and received the ticket to board the space station. Oh, and that Master Capote you talked about. Him being so nice to you shows that there are more good people than not in the cosmos, or why would the stories of the Galaxy Ranger be passing around everywhere? If you are a big celebrity on the space station as you say, then you need to be even more careful and restrained. Please don't mind my nagging, I just don't want you to be impulsive and pay the price for it. A mother knows her son better than anyone ever could.<br><br>Well, that's all the reminders I have for you. I've been dreaming about you lately. In my dream, you locked yourself in a black house. It makes me very worried. Maybe it's because I'm getting old. I let my imaginations get the better of me and it's been affecting my sleep. I'm always worrying about if your work is going well, if you're eating enough, if you've lost weight, if you're wearing enough clothes... and all sorts of other questions. I had the Astral Logistics send you a pair of wool pants I spent an entire season knitting, but it was rejected by the space station... They said that everyone there wears protective uniforms and have no use for something crude like this. Your dad was furious and tossed the pants in the new house we purchased for you. We basically spent all the savings we had from harvesting spices on that house. We're not recklessly spending money. There aren't many other luxuries to be had with the Slinkans ruling the place. We both hope that you can get married and start a family of your own soon. But if you don't plan on staying on Xin-41, then that's a whole different story. After all, that would be something completely beyond both of our imaginations.<br><br>Oh Shuu, Mom wishes you health and happiness. Hop on a warp ship soon and come home to us.<br><br>***S E A L***"

The Leviathan's Conception Theory believes that some elder Leviathans were run aground after the Dusk Wars. During their lengthy slumber, their decomposed cells became the seedbed for organic organisms, and their dissipating life force became wandering Astral Spirits. However, more and more scholars have begun to publicly denounce the Leviathan's Conception Theory in recent years. Other nascent theories are not included here.<br><br>In the beginning, the Astral Spirits did not possess individual wills, and all they did was float and wander aimlessly in the cosmos. During the era of Trailblaze, as the Nameless traversed the cosmic expanse, the Astral Spirits became allured by the humans' freedom of travel. The mortal beings possessing the strong emotions of love and lust made a strong impact on the barren core of the Astral Spirits. Humans have become the most desirable hosts for Astral Spirits. The Astral Spirits would follow the scent of emotions and find their prey, possess their body, and turn the host into a mindless walking corpse. Hosts that aren't able to fuse with the Astral Spirits will die on spot. A verified case of a Nameless named Erwin Hessler became possessed by an Astral Spirit and managed to form a symbiotic relationship with it. Those possessed by Astral Spirits and ended in tragedy are lost as time goes on.<br><br>Afterward, these types of spiritual organisms hid and blended into human society. Their exceptional abilities to sense emotion and control people's hearts and minds are feared by many.<br><br>Wubbaboos have inherited the abilities of their Astral Spirit ancestors, but are not as deadly. On their own, Wubbaboos enjoy scaring people and appear as ghostly, semi-transparent, shifting forms.

Soak the sticks in the underground water and skewer the meat. A buddy found some candied mushrooms, so we added those in between the meat for extra flavor.<br><br>Finally, sprinkle some salt and chili powder gently onto the meat several times as it's grilling.<br><br>No matter how bad the meat tastes, you can swallow it as long as you have salt and chili powder.<br><br>The funniest thing is we were about to eat when the rescue team dug out the rescue tunnel. \"We were trying to rescue you as soon as possible, and you're here eating satay!\"<br><br>Try it when you have the chance.

Small-sized fruiting body, flat cap with a dimple and gills, 0.5–2 cm in diameter, smooth, dry, with its color fading from cyan to light-blue, becoming lighter towards the center. The stipe is 3–5 cm, 1 mm or thicker, smooth, curved, and hollow. The cap is covered in shining dust, making the mushroom give off a blue glow in the dark.<br><br>This Blue Lamp Umbrella is edible, but this is not recommended because its flesh is hard to chew. It's used primarily by some clinics for pharmaceutical purposes. Fungi of the Blue Lamp family have analgesic effects, which have proven effective for trigeminal neuralgia, migraines, fracture pains, and rheumatoid arthritis. The discovery of this fungi has done wonders for miners who commonly suffer from these problems. Its name \"umbrella\" was borrowed from a common object to describe its shape, but over time, underground people forgot what an umbrella was.<br><br><br>Corrosive Ore Moss<br><br><i>\"Random thoughts creep up in an abandoned mine lit up by an eerie green light.\"</i><br><br>Corrosive ore moss is a small plant with subspherical reflex cells on top, usually found in cave entrances or abandoned geomarrow mines. The plant absorbs the moisture and organic matter in the air through its compact structure, secreting acidic substances constantly during the growth process. In geomarrow mines, the acidic substances dissolve geomarrow powder, creating a chemical reaction that will release weak light and energy.<br><br>Its strong protonema is usually round and can reflect or refract light into a greenish glow. In the depths of a cave where there is almost no light, this moss is still capable of using photosynthesis to survive. There is an ecological phenomenon, known as the \"Moss Corridor\" where the mossy overgrowth expands to unimaginable proportions inside a Geomarrow mine.<br><br><br>Zombie General<br><br><i>\"This really is a zombie...\"</i><br><br>The zombie general is not an actual zombie, nor is it a real general, it's just the name of a dead giant banyan tree. The giant banyan tree existed long before the Eternal Freeze. This single tree extended to form an entire forest and a famous eco-attraction. To extend their respect, the people at the time named this tree \"General Sherba.\" When the Eternal Freeze came about, the exposed parts of General Sherba died in the frost and snow. However, in its slow process of agony and death, the roots of General Sherba kept growing and took over underground water sources to absorb even more energy. The expansion of its underground root system continued even after the main tree had died.<br><br>The elder members of the Geomarrow Development Group who remembered General Sherba were shocked the first time they ran into the roots because Belobog was more than a hundred kilometers away from the general. From this point on, the ever-growing roots were referred to by the people as the \"zombie general.\" Even to this day, the zombie general still acts as a very important source of materials for the Underworld and its people. As for the overall cultivation of the roots, it would be safe to say that less than 1% of it has been tapped into."

Azure Ghost Umbrella is very similar to the Blue Lamp Umbrella in terms of shape, sharing a belly-button shape in the middle and has grooves. The color is pure indigo with no gradient. The key difference between it and Blue Lamp Umbrellas is the presence of subtle white spots, which is harder to detect in darker environments.<br><br>50 grams of this highly-toxic poison is enough to kill an adult weighing 50 kilograms. Its toxins are mainly amatoxins and toxic peptides, both of which are extremely high in fresh Azure Ghost Umbrella. When ingested, these toxins can cause serious damage to the liver, kidney, blood vessel linings, and the central nervous system, resulting in organ failure and eventually death.<br><br>Its resemblance to the Blue Lamp Umbrella had resulted in several accidental poisoning incidents within the Geomarrow Development Group at its early stage. Their response was the massive search and destruction of these fungi. It would be hard to find them now.

Don't be fooled by such a nickname!\"</i><br><br>Aroma Ether Grass is commonly found in caves with high levels of radiation. Its thick short stems store rich aroma volatiles. At low temperatures, the plant leaves quickly produce a scent that attracts many underground creatures. The scent also has a hypnotic effect and creatures eventually huddle around the plant to sleep.<br><br>The creatures gathered around look like a group of children listening to a story quietly, which is why this plant has been nicknamed \"Fairy Tale King.\" However, sleeping in a cave with high radiation levels isn't as sweet as a fairy tale. The volatile chemicals are also effective on humans, but usually do not manage to sedate healthy adults. The Underground markets have made use of the extracted chemicals by diluting it to create aromatherapy products that help with sleep.<br><br>Soothing Mushroom<br><br><i>\"This is way better than ordinary painkillers!\"</i><br><br>Soothing Mushroom, medium-sized soft body, thick cap, 4-8cm wide, convex cap, black and green with ciliiform scales and inwardly curled edges. Soothing Mushroom contains a special chemical named psilocybin, which is a serotonin-receptor blocker. It can block neuronal connections when serotonin becomes lacking, resulting in a partial loss of sensation for the person.<br><br>It was once used as an analgesic due to its special neuron blocking characteristics. However, psilocybin doesn't just block pain. During the test phase, ingesting the Soothing Mushroom blocker also resulted in negative effects on the function of various bodily organs. It wasn't until an outside medical expert modified the formula by lowering the dosage and using regional injections that the analgesic ability was realized."

I cried for the longest time after you moved away because I thought you'd forgotten me. So imagine my surprise when I received the cookies you sent me a few days ago. I couldn't stop thinking about you, so much so that I couldn't do well on a test. My father said it's just an excuse, but I really do believe that it was your fault. Same as this fever.<br><br>My father said I could go visit you over the weekend, but we live too far apart. He thought after some time, maybe several months, or the next Solwarm Festival, we'd make new friends, and we'd gradually forget about each other. That's what happened to him when he was younger. When I asked him about it, he looked away and it was only then that I noticed his face had turned red.<br><br>My mother was reading my letter just now, but now they're gone.<br><br>I understand why my father is worried. You'd better send cookies to me every week and I'll also write to you. If you think it is unfair, then you can write to me and I'll bake you some cookies. My parents are back now. My mother said it would be nice if we'd work in the same factory. That's where my parents met.<br><br>Adults think they know everything. They think we want to get married, but our relationship isn't like that at all. They don't know anything about us. Right now, they're giggling to themselves. If I didn't have a fever, I'd write this letter in secret and mail it myself, so they wouldn't be able to read it.<br><br>I want to become a scientist, capable of creating the largest furnace this world has ever seen. That way, when we go out to the Outer Municipal District, we won't have to wear so many layers of clothing. Do you remember?

Here, we've compiled a list of your favorite ways to eat it. Which type is your favorite?<br><br>The first way is to eat it as is. The sausage itself is already cooked and has been processed in many ways. It can be eaten as a snack or as a side dish. Its original taste alone is already delicious!<br><br>The second way is to cook it with hammer peppers. The sausage can be stir-fried with many vegetables, but hammer peppers are undoubtedly the best choice. Stir-frying causes the aroma of the sausage to complement the strong fragrance of the peppers, allowing for a more unique flavor.<br><br>The third way is to grill it. Cut across the sausage before putting it on the grill. Served with spices, it's great as street snack.<br><br>The fourth way is to wrap it in suncakes. Make a suncake wrap by adding thin slices of the sausage. This method not only enriches the taste of the suncake, but also balances out the sausage's flavor. Well worth a taste!<br><br>Over the years, upgrades to the process and machinery have greatly improved production capacity. The fat but not greasy characteristic is unique to this sausage. Its original delicious taste has been retained, and various flavors are now available for consumers to choose from.<br><br>To celebrate Belobog's centenary, the Belobog Meat Factory is offering discounts on all products to all customers.

I've found this method helpful for treating the illness.<br><br>Some would believe that the metaphors of dreams are meaningless, but I don't quite agree. Dreams can stir up patient's feelings and emotions, which, at the very least, indicates a connection with the patient's feelings or experiences.<br><br>But what exactly are these dream metaphors? I've read so much about it. But the Old World literature is incomplete, and I don't have a definitive answer. What's interesting is that there is a link between dreams and reality.

To my knowledge, the ritual exists only in the distant past and the people around her had no means of knowing about it to begin with. No one told her about the ritual, so how did she know about it? This is why I believe that some dreams can be affected and influenced by others. But I have no idea how this \"sharing\" and the concept behind it works.<br><br>I am also reminded of one more thing.

It will be split equally between the Criminal Welfare Society and Charice Hospital.\"<br><br>The performance was conducted by George himself. The entire Architect Goliards Chorus was in attendance. It was an unprecedented event, evident by the tickets being sold out the day it was available. The new concert hall, with 1,500 seats fully booked for the premiere, was unable to meet the demand. On the day of the premiere, the concert hall asked ladies \"better not to wear bustle dresses\" and gentlemen \"better not to carry swords,\" so that there would be more room for the audience. In total, 1,800 guests crammed into the concert hall, with many of them sitting on the steps of the walkway to watch the premiere of <i>Supreme Guardian</i>. The performance was a sensation, and famous music critic Borovsky praised, \"Words cannot express the shock and joy that this amazing performance brought to the full house.\"<br><br>On the day after the premiere, the <i>Crystal Daily</i> devoted a full page to <i>Supreme Guardian</i> and its performance. The article stated: \"Exquisite, grand, and gentle — We had to search through the dictionary for the most elegant, majestic, and vivid words to describe the baptism of joys experienced by our ears and souls.\" As promised, after deducting the expenses for the orchestra and the concert hall, George donated all the remaining proceeds to the Criminal Welfare Society and Charice Hospital.<br><br>By January 19, the Belobog residents' demand for a second show had grown more intense. At the request of Qlipoth Fort, an encore of \"Supreme Guardian\" was quickly arranged and performed at the Golden Theater (the new concert hall had other shows arranged).

Some critics think this will become an unspoken rule that the audience should stand for this part of the show in the future.<br><br>After the show, Supreme Guardian Cocolia personally took to the stage to thank George. It is reported that the proceeds of the second show, after deducting expenses, were donated to the Children's Education Committee.

It's the undercurrent caused by a large amount of frostweave salmon in search of a spawning ground! It is also the time of year that they are the fattest, because they stock up the energy and nutrients to prepare for the swim upstream, during which they are unable to feed.<br><br>The Belobog fishing teams head out to prepare for the seasonal hunts. Through efficient and large-scale hunting, the city's frostweave salmon reserves are plentiful. Of course, the proximity of the hunting ground to Belobog means the cruel and extreme temperature and climate have their risks. Such a grand scale of fishing can only be read through the articles.<br><br>But, starting this year, you can also be a part of the fishing parties!<br><br>Three years ago, Belobog approved the \"Fishing and Hunting Co-Op Program.\" After a two-year trial run, they're finally ready to open up registrations. As one of the members who participated in the trial run, I will be starting a new column, \"Fishing and Hunting Co-Op,\" in the <i>Voyager</i>. The column will cover travel preparation, delicious foods, and various activities, as well as aspects of the co-op program that may require special attention.<br><br>As the saying goes, \"the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.\" For the first issue, we will be focusing on the unique delicacy, frostweave salmon bread.<br><br>Everyone knows that the frostweave salmon we get in the city has been processed to prolong preservation. After the head and guts are removed, the salmon is salted and dried. This process brings out the flavor that we are so familiar with. However, the salmon at the reserves taste even better. The frostweave salmon will freeze quickly out of the water. It can be said that you can't get salmon any fresher than this.<br><br>The most traditional frostweave salmon dish, which is highly recommended by the head chef of the fishing parties, is the frostweave salmon bread. It is simple to make, so here are the steps:<br><br>• You will need to have sliced your bread beforehand. It will take a lot of effort to cut it in this cold climate.<br>• You will also need to prepare the redsunset jam beforehand. Cut the redsunset into pieces along with various berries, then stir with seasoning. Be sure to store it in a thermal container, or you will have to melt the jam with hot water, which will be difficult.<br>• Cut the frostweave salmon into slices. You can ask the chefs from the fishing team to help with this step. Next, you will need to peel off the skin, then place the fish meat and jam onto the bread. And there you have it, an authentic serving of frostweave salmon bread.<br><br>As you may have noticed, the most troublesome ingredient of the recipe is the fresh frostweave salmon, which may be hard to come by in Belobog. You'll find plenty of it at the fishing reserves though. The salmon's freshness and the jam's acidity produce a smooth texture that will have you salivating within seconds. The tenderness of the fish, with a lighter fish stench and more fatty meat, is different from the dry salmon that we're used to. It is truly unforgettable and definitely worth a trip to the reserves.<br><br>Of course, the fishing parties have a minimum amount of salmon that they must catch before tourist activities can begin. Rest assured, there's plenty of frostweave salmon to go around. The co-op program will only require a one-time fee. In other words, tourists who participate are free to eat as much as they want within the fishing reserves.<br><br>Next time, we'll be taking a look at how to stay warm in the frigid cold. Stay tuned, avid travelers. This is Lila and I'll see you in the next issue."

In the future, feel free to communicate with me and I'd be more than happy to give you constructive feedback, making your work easier.<br><br>I heard your magazine, <i>Voyager</i>, is a young media company only recently established. Plenty of challenges await in the future. An unwed woman like yourself will surely need an outstanding partner to face those challenges together. Allow me to re-introduce myself. For three consecutive years, I've been voted as the backbone of the magazine, <i>Crystal Daily</i>. Many colleagues call me \"the one who is most daring to speak out.\" Of course, in our line of work, that is a good quality to have. In my spare time, I participate in various sports. I'm exceptionally good at long-distance running and have won many rewards for the suburban snow cross-country. I think you'll find that there aren't many men like me.<br><br>However, if you do like me, please don't become too attached. Fate guides our love, and we must do our utmost for Belobog. What kind of love would require us to sacrifice our job? What kind of love would have us be filled with guilt and shame?<br><br>Please respond within 7 days of reading this later. Otherwise, I will be too busy to <i>*The rest of the torn letter is missing.*</i>"

Can't they hire someone competent for the patent review? I've applied for a patent for 16 times already. What a waste of time and energy! How will they reimburse me if someone registers my invention first?<br><br>Time is life. They're stealing my money, ruining my life.<br><br>I thought the guy with glasses at the patent office would know a thing or two, but I was wrong. He questioned me to my face and said I knew nothing about science. What the heck does he know? I've studied physics for 15 years and wrote <i>Time Tunnel Theory</i>, a 100,000-word book. My invention is based on that theory. He hasn't even read my book, and he has the nerve to doubt me? Childish! Stupid! Shortsighted!<br><br>I've been working on this device for quite some time. But two months ago, when the museum opened an exhibit showcasing newly discovered Old World relics, I was 100% sure that time travel might come true. There was a mysterious device called the \"600-Kilowatt Diesel Generator,\" which was exactly the same machine that appeared in my dreams. With that machine, my device would surely be able to warp time, deform it, cause massive breaks, and create time tunnels.<br><br>The prophetic dream perfectly confirmed my theory. In my dream, there was a Geomarrow resonance tunnel hidden in the Underworld. When my time tunnel device is completed, I would definitely be able to achieve time travel there!<br><br>Rather than waiting for those fools to review my patent, why don't I raise the money myself to build the device? Right now, I only have the house to mortgage, but it belongs to my father. I don't know if he'll agree to the mortgage, but I'm a little reluctant to do so since we've lived there for many years... No no, what am I saying? If I can create a time tunnel, I'd transform the era! I'd be the modern-day Plamya! How would I shed tears on a house? Let's do it. I'll mortgage the house next week and get my device built.<br><br>With my device, I could warp the very fabric of time and control its flow. A place like Belobog wouldn't be befitting for someone like me.<br><br>Oh my, I could revolutionize the Belobog... No, the entire universe!"

My dear Belobog friends, have you made your suncakes? The reporter visited an ordinary household in Belobog. They talked about what preparations they had done and what the Solwarm Festival meant to them.<br><br>The interviewee this time are a young member of the Silvermane Guards and his family. The interview was scheduled for the morning before the Solwarm Festival. The husband was preparing to go out and purchase food for the Solwarm Festival, while the wife stayed home to watch the child.<br><br>Reporter:<br>Hello, sorry to intrude. I'm Abel, the one who contacted you before.<br><br>Ethan:<br>Ah... no problem. It's my first interview so I'm a bit nervous.<br><br>Reporter:<br>Can you please introduce yourselves?<br><br>Ethan:<br>I'm Ethan and I'm a soldier. This is my wife, Hannah, and our child, little Beck.<br><br>Hannah:<br>Hello, I'm Hannah and I work at the library.<br><br>Beck:<br>... Boock.<br><br>Reporter:<br>Beck is so cute. How old is he?<br><br>Hannah:<br>He just turned one.<br><br>Beck: <br>Ge... Tad.<br><br>Reporter:<br>It seems like he's trying to say something. Are you going out for groceries? Why are you bringing so many things with you?<br><br>Ethan:<br>Actually, I've asked for a leave of absence. My plan for today is to take some comfort foods to my good friends on the Frontline first, then head to the market.<br><br>Beck: <br>Ge Tad.<br><br>Hannah:<br>Shh...<br><br>Reporter:<br>Your friends must be happy. By the way, is little Beck talking already?<br><br>Hannah:<br>No no, he can only say a few simple words.<br><br>Beck:<br>Ge! Tad!<br><br>Reporter:<br>Hahaha, that's still very impressive for his age. What's he trying to say...?<br><br>Hannah:<br>Gepard the scoundrel.<br><br>Ethan:<br>I... don't agree with him. I always respect the Captain.<br><br>Reporter:<br>Well, I won't keep you. While you're out shopping, I'll interview your wife.<br><br>Ethan:<br>Wait... I'll go out later. Not sure what you will talk about during the interview.<br><br>Ethan and Hannah have been married for more than two years. According to Solwarm Festival customs, the newlywed husband Ethan should bring ingredients and make suncakes with his mother-in-law. However, he has been on duty during the festival for two consecutive years due to the nature of his job. This year, Ethan can finally enjoy his Solwarm Festival holidays, which also gives him the opportunity to impress everyone with his cooking skills at his in-law's.<br><br>Ethan:<br>To be honest, I still don't know how to make it...<br><br>Hannah:<br>It's because you don't care. If the reporter didn't bring it up, you'd probably have forgotten it all. What would you have my mother eat?<br><br>Ethan:<br>Ah... Eh...<br><br>Reporter:<br>Please stop fighting. Little Beck just fell asleep. I see... Ethan doesn't usually cook, right?<br><br>Ethan:<br>Yeah, my wife usually cooks, since my job...<br><br>Hannah:<br>There you go again with your excuses. I'm busy with work too, but I make the time to cook. It all depends on whether you want to or not.<br><br>Reporter:<br>How about this? Why don't we learn how to make suncakes now?<br><br>With an apron on and a kitchen knife in hand, Ethan looked every bit a pro despite it being his first time cooking. Even though it was his first time, Hannah, his wife, didn't seem too keen to help him in any way. She whispered to the reporter that she was going to use this opportunity to teach her husband a lesson.<br><br>So, Ethan looked up the recipe for suncakes and followed it step-by-step. Add sugar and salt to three eggs and beat quickly. Add in Moo-Moo Milk and flour and mix until thick. While mixing, Ethan also removed the lumps in the mixture, which is good for a beginner. He brushed the pan with a light layer of oil and then the egg mixture. And the suncakes are done!<br><br>In high spirits, Ethan also cooked the frost grained cod. The reporter was honored to be invited to lunch.<br><br>Reporter:<br>Even though it's your first time, it seems like you know what you were doing...<br><br>Ethan:<br>I'm still a little nervous.<br><br>Hannah:<br>... Then let's dig in first.<br><br>The reporter had eaten a lot of suncakes over the years, but never had he eaten one so rich in flavor. It wasn't too salty or sweet, and it had the perfect texture. It's hard to imagine that Ethan made this on his first try. Add a touch of yogurt honey and Frostweave Salmon and the suncakes were ready to be sold in stores!<br><br>The interview was once put on hold as the reporter and Hannah helped Ethan in the kitchen, making almost 100 suncakes. It was already towards dusk before they realized it, and it wasn't until they heard little Beck's cries that the young couple came to realize their child hadn't eaten lunch.<br><br>This is an unexpectedly warm incident in an interview with a family. Let's wish Ethan a great debut at his mother-in-law's.<br><br>By the way, the suncakes were so delicious that the reporter took 50 suncakes to go."

Just don't forget what I taught you and you'll be fine. I know you pick up on things fast.<br><br>However, the maintenance of heating pipes is the most important maintenance job in Belobog.

Remember to ask Bel if you have any questions.<br><br>I won't go over the first and second points because there's nothing to say about getting the certificate and wearing protection. Those are too basic. For the third point, check the lighting for the heating maintenance area. You should pay special attention, especially to the emergency lighting. There was an accident in the past with my master where the furnace wasn't lit. No lighting is a recipe for accidents.<br><br>The fourth point on changing the pipes' protective coating has one missing point at the top, remember to ALWAYS wear insulation gloves. The pipes are full of hot steam and there's no insulation around them. One touch and you will be scalded. I have taught you the ratio to mix the protective coating liquid and water, so be careful. It doesn't matter if you waste some coating liquid, just don't add too much water! The pipes' surface temperature is very high, so if you brush a very watery liquid onto it, the room will fill with water vapor. If something goes wrong, it can be fatal. As for how to apply the coating, you already know this. Brush it thinly and evenly, don't go back and forth.<br><br>The eighth point goes over the most important thing — maintenance of the steam turbine rotor. Halfway through the maintenance, be sure to check your maintenance clothes' electrical insulation and protective goggles. Also, when going back for maintenance, please remember to stop the boiler and generator. This is a delicate device and if it breaks, there's no replacing it for a while. You can't be too careful with it. For the tenth point, the alarms and monitoring devices we use now are different from the ones in the manual. Just go with what I taught you.<br><br>That's about it. Once the heating maintenance is complete, you'll be a full-fledged maintenance worker.<br><br>Come by during the Solwarm Festival and I'll treat you to a special suncake.

He hurls his ax at his enemies and summons bolts of lightning before it returns to his hand. Perun exterminates demons that scourge across the skies with fiery arrows from his war chariot — what later became known as thunder and lightning to the world.<br><br>Veles, a sworn enemy of Perun and previously also the god of war, now oversees the land, water, forest, and the underworld. Veles takes a half-human and half-snake form, with horns of bulls on his head, a thick coat of fur, and a long beard. He herds cattle in the Land of Death while controlling wealth, rewards, music, and the night. He is an expert in magic and trickery.<br><br>Pursuing Veles across the Earth, the enraged Perun cares not for the things that Veles shapeshifts to hide behind and strikes them down with indifference, even the humans. The mischievous Veles climbs from the damp underground to steal Perun's cattle, wife, and children.<br><br>On the last night of February, Perun's 10th son Jarilo was born. It was also that night that he was stolen and brought to the Land of Death where Veles raises him. Land of Death is a lush prairie of eternal spring across the sea where Jarilo helps his foster father guard the cattle. Birds migrate to that land every winter.<br><br>Jarilo didn't like to spend his life underground. He is the god of youth and life with the powers of reproduction and plant growth. At the end of winter, Jarilo would return to Earth and use the full extent of his powers as the god of springtime and war to drive the cold and darkness away. This process was difficult but necessary to bring about spring to the world.<br><br>Jarilo was first noticed and welcomed by the goddess of nature and death, Morana, who is Perun's daughter and Jarilo's sister. The two quickly fell in love and celebrated their wedding in the summer. The sacred unification of Jarilo and Morana symbolized a promise of fertility and lush vegetation. It also meant a temporary peace between Perun and Veles, and the late summer harvest would be successful and bountiful.<br><br>However, Jarilo was not a faithful husband. In retaliation to his disloyalty, Morana killed Jarilo and used his corpse to build a new home. Without her husband, Morana gradually became a depressed old witch. The frightening and dangerous goddess of death would bring about a cold bitter winter. Morana would die at the year's end, being reborn as Vesna. At the same time, Jarilo would also be reborn and the myth would start all over again.<br><br>The endless cycle of life and death continued for a long time. The unfaithful Jarilo getting killed after the autumn harvest and the lonely Morana dying at the end of the year. The two gods were reborn and fell in love again, ensuring the bountiful harvest every year. It wasn't until one year when Morana killed Jarilo as usual, but the house she built was weak and collapsed. With no shelter in the frigid winter, Morana's anger could not be contained any longer, and she no longer accepted her fate of reconciling with Jarilo every year. As the goddess of nature and death, she placed a cruel curse on herself — the next time she died she would no longer be reborn as Vesna, the goddess of youth and springtime.<br><br>The curse worked. This time, while Morana did became a dangerous witch in her solitude, she didn't die at the end of the year. The cold and darkness raged on, far greater than ever before. It even continued to span across the following year. When Jarilo was reborn into this desolate place, Morana finally died, never to be reborn. Faced with the ruthless winter, Jarilo realized that he had made a mistake. Spring would not come this year, and Jarilo could not face the cold nights alone.<br><br>In his desperation, Jarilo decided to look for his father, Perun, chief of the gods, to seek repentance and forgiveness. Having heard the story of the two, Perun sympathized with Morana, but could not accept her curse. Without spring, the world would slowly die in the cold winter nights. The wise Perun pointed out Jarilo's sin of arrogance, and prophesied — should Jarilo once again be able to offer his eternal love and loyalty to Morana, only then will her anger be quelled.<br><br>The proud Jarilo fell into a deep depression, and the cold storm continued to rage on even till the autumn harvest. At the end of the story, the remorseful Jarilo offers to sacrifice his reincarnation, swearing everlasting and deep loyalty to his deceased lover. Perun's prophecy came true. Jarilo's remorse and longing turned into a warm and forgiving spring that covered the land and protected the people, enabling them to live happily and peacefully on in the snow-torn world."

                "Desc": "<i>Jarilo: God of Spring and War</i> Analysis<br><br>Folklore Expert: Chico<br><br>One of the earliest historical references to the god is in the biography of a diplomat from the Saya kingdom, about 1,800 years before the Eternal Freeze. On his expedition, he came across a tribe who happened to be celebrating the god of war, Jarroway. Experts from before the Eternal Freeze believed Jarroway to be the precursor of Jarilo.<br><br>Around 1,200 years ago, in the northern region of Nycatha, a festival known as \"Jarilo\" was celebrated in late spring or early summer. Groups of villagers would walk along the countryside, symbolizing the return of the god back into this world. His return meant fertility and vegetation. Experts from before the Eternal Freeze found traces of religious rituals in honor of this god.<br><br>The death of a god was seen as a ritualistic sacrifice, and carries heavy symbolic meaning. Similar metaphors can be found in other mythologies: The bodies of dead gods creating the world, with blood turning into rivers, bones turning into mountains, hair turning into forests, and so on. With the emergence of the Eternal Freeze, the world of the gods gradually began to weaken. Until eventually, the house built from Jarilo's corpse could no longer support human life and collapsed, just like it did in the myth.<br><br>It is clear the myth's ending was influenced by the Eternal Freeze and the new religions. Before the Eternal Freeze, Jarilo was the typical \"birth-death-rebirth\" god of nature, whose mythological cycle was the same as that of crops in the northern region of Nycatha, from sowing to growing to harvesting (viewed as crop destruction). However, after the Eternal Freeze, the seasonal cycle was broken, replaced by Belobog's unique climate. In the myth, this climate change is explained by the household affairs between the gods.<br><br>It's worth mentioning that in the story, Jarilo goes on a journey from an unfaithful bum to a loyal husband. By the end of the story, he sought redemption from Perun, paying a heavy price for his indiscretions. The changes in Jarilo here were thought to be related to the changing lunar phases, a projection of human understanding on natural phenomena. This understanding continued to hold after the Eternal Freeze emerged and people could no longer observe the moon's phase changes. There was a lack of understanding of such astronomical phenomena, so people were more inclined to draw a moral conclusion to the story — this god's endless cycle of birth-death-rebirth was the price to pay for his love."

Invaded by a strong cold front beyond Nycatha in the north, the center and suburbs of the Overworld were violently hit by ice storms. This short bout of freezing rain brought a special phenomenon known as glaze to Belobog. Long icicles have formed on many structures and trees.<br><br>Thanks to the Architects' protection, Belobog remains warm all year long, but there are still rare occasions when such freezing rain enters the city. We have specially invited a Belobog meteorologist, Professor Yegard, to give us a brief introduction to the weather phenomenon called \"ice storms.\"<br><br>Reporter Millie (hereinafter referred to as M): Hello, Professor Yegard.<br><br>Professor Yegard (hereinafter referred to as Y): Hello.<br><br>M: Last week, Belobog's suburbs and the Underworld experienced a rare ice storm. Can you give a brief explanation of the causes?<br><br>Y: At the weather station, we usually call an ice storm \"freezing rain.\" They refer to the same meteorological phenomenon. Before we talk about freezing rain, I must first mention the abnormally low temperatures that often occur in Belobog around the Solwarm Festival.<br><br>M: I believe you're referring to the Belobog Winter, right? The news has made announcements about it in every region.<br><br>Y: The general lowering temperature became combined with the sudden freezing air coming from outside the Belobog greenhouse area, which rushed to the suburbs and formed freezing rain. The urban heat island of Belobog has its core in the city center, so the temperature there was higher, causing only rain to form.<br><br>M: It's more like sleet where I live. What makes freezing rain special is the glaze. How is glaze formed?<br><br>Y: That's because the cold and warm air collided when the cold air entered the city. Under that collision layer, the air and ground temperatures drop below freezing. But above that layer, the air is relatively wet and temperatures are above freezing. As raindrops fall into regions where the air temperature is lower than freezing, they form supercooled water drops.<br><br>M: So supercooled water drops are water droplets below the freezing point?<br><br>Y: Yes, since the temperature near the ground is lower, the supercooled water drops form a thin layer of crystal-clear ice when they touch buildings, trees, vegetation, or roads. These glaze formations formed by supercooled water drops on trees are what people usually call \"icicles.\"<br><br>M: So that's how it works. Based on your description, is freezing rain actually a rather rare occurrence?<br><br>Y: That's right. There's only a short time before and after the Solwarm Festival when air temperature decreases in which this natural phenomenon can occur. Citizens are free to enjoy this beautiful glaze scenery in the suburbs. With proper attire and safety conditions, of course.<br><br>M: Thank you, Professor Yegard, for taking the time to teach us about freezing rain.<br><br>Y: You're welcome."

                "Desc": "To all vagrants who dig for ancient relics,<br><br>Regrettably, I will be stopping my appraisal services at the end of this tax period. The consulting location at the market will also be closed.<br><br>In other words, from this day forward, if you stumble over something in the mines, or if your mining team happens upon an ancient weapon, don't think it's a gift from the gods. And don't bother carrying all that junk over to me.<br><br>As mentioned above, it's done. I'm done.<br><br>I'm sure some of you will be pondering the reason behind my quitting when work is going well. I suppose I should make the effort to give everyone a proper response.<br><br>First of all, it's a thankless job.<br><br>When I started this business, I wanted to use the Old World manuals I tirelessly collected to help everyone analyze and appraise their ancient relics. That way, everyone would at least have a sense of the items they found, and can have a better sense of value when selling their items.<br><br>It's pretty clear for those who know. These days, no one understands how people from the Old World built these machines, much less the knowledge they had in their heads.<br><br>Some ancient relics explode when exposed to the air, making it more dangerous than a mine filled with gas. Some were as plain as a metal rod, not unlike the one your wife uses to poke the stove. But push the button somewhere on it, it'll be as scary as one of your wife's temper tantrums.<br><br>Let me give you an example. During the last tax period, I received an egg-shaped object. (That's right, the kind of egg sold at Belobog Meat Factory.) Anyway, I went through all the manuscripts, including Old World magazines, and finally concluded that it was some kind of jewelry, known as the \"Ramlea Egg.\"<br><br>Let's start with a question: What is jewelry? After asking old Uther, we learned that jewelry is a type of decoration you can wear. It seems that Old World people really had nothing better to do.<br><br>The old man banged the egg a few times on the table, then removed the pin on top, which might have been used to hang something on it. Suddenly, the egg started heating up and glowing. It produced a light stronger than hundreds of mine lamps stacked together (Uther might have exaggerated this). The old man could already barely see anything, and now he definitely can't. You can say that I was lucky. When the incident happened, I was in the other room making tea. My eyes were fine but the old man's son threatened to take out my eyes until I offered him sixty canned goods.<br><br>Do you understand now? I'm putting my life on the line for you guys, but the money you're paying me won't even cover my medical fees.<br><br>Right, here's the second point: Miner's Lamp's standards were called into question.<br><br>The area outside Boulder Town is getting more and more dangerous and more and more vagrants are coming here. But with more people, comes more gossip. I've heard enough of foolish things like \"Balaway is a blind appraiser,\" or \"Any vagrant from Rivet Town is better than him.\" I don't know what game they're playing with this slander, but I'm not interested. Better to simply pack my bags and leave. After all, it should be easy to find a better appraiser, right?<br><br>I have been faithfully serving you lucky dogs in the past and never thought of coveting the ancient goods you dug up. The very reason is that I am an honest person and have never done anything to cheat. But what about those outsiders? Can you trust them? They are nothing but a bunch of self-serving scoundrels who only care for themselves. They will denigrate those goods you value, but if you believe their nonsense and sold your goods to them as if you were selling scraps, then they will happily take them to flip for a high price elsewhere.<br><br>But, Miner's Lamp Balaway is not a heartless person. I can make exceptions.<br><br>If the treasure you have is of great value, I might still be able to help you check it out. Think of me as being so fervently compassionate about no one getting cheated out of their fortune that I'll break my hiatus for these exceptional cases. But if it's just a piece of scrap, I suggest you find someone else. Balaway has henceforth ended his appraisal services."

She is a little out of touch with the rest of society, so she doesn't know how to call for help, even when she's in a tight spot.\" \"But Howard's actions come from the heart.\" Taking this into consideration, Iain told us that because of this incident, this stage direction was written into the official script.<br><br>\"Throughout the rehearsals of <i>Stardust Rose</i>, we were infected with a wonderful atmosphere. While we had to perform in front of many people, as the plot developed toward the end, I think we must have entered a kind of blissful flow state.

This likely helped to preserve his mental health during the incident. The miner's actions seriously violated many regulations in the <i>Miner's Safety Manual</i>, but fortunately no one was seriously injured. The appropriate punishment and re-education will be implemented after he recovers.<br><br>Rivet Town–Fragmentum Monster Encounters Intensifies<br><br>Encounters between Rivet Town and the Fragmentum monsters intensify. According to information from Wildfire, there is a trend of the monsters that have invaded Rivet Town leaving the town. Thanks to the traffic blockade on the main road, a small number of these mindless monsters left the town and were dealt with by Wildfire.<br><br>Years ago, Rivet Town was completely overrun by monsters from the Fragmentum, and is now in a state of abandonment. All miners please stay away from this place as much as possible. Don't let greed tempt you to return for property and possessions. Please ensure that personal safety is a top priority."

Steve immediately decided to fish for Rock Crabs with his fellow workers and delivered three large bags of Rock Crab caught to the Great Mine administrative office.

When these two ingredients are mixed with the mushroom, the unique aroma of the latter will be stimulated, so it cannot be substituted! <br>2. The stem of the puffy mushroom is woody, astringent, and tough, while the cap is fluffy and crispy, so the cap must be used for cooking! <br>3. The blanching process doesn't take too long, just two minutes. Blanching for longer will worsen the taste of the mushrooms!"

Everything I've seen and all my experiences from traveling are reflected in my novels. If it wasn't for family, I really wouldn't be helping out at the cafe.<br><br>Tuesday, March 21st<br>The customers today were basically all young couples. There was one curious pair. The man was yakking on to the woman about his history of \"starting a business from scratch.\" It was so awkward, but the lady seemed to enjoy it. I stood in front of the counter and listened in for a long time until my back hurt. I was trying to look for some inspiration, but there was laughably none to be found.<br><br>Friday, March 24th<br>Two times in a row, it was the lady who paid the bill. And judging from their clothes, she was rich, and he wasn't. While the nature of love does not discriminate based on wealth, the \"rich girl, poor guy\" trope is excellent writing material. A rich but innocent girl meets a poor loaf with an ulterior motive. Love takes root from the seed of lies.<br><br><i>\"She was immersed in this fantasy, completely ignoring the falsehood it concealed. This may be the first time in her youth that someone is willing to talk to her so patiently. Her fantasy and thirst for love, and the shackles of her family that bind her have now come so closely together. Even though they have only met twice in the café, she is already at a loss, completely absorbed this great white bliss. So much so that she would not doubt that this was all an elaborate ruse. Because up till now, no one else has even had the thought of deceiving her. Not to mention, deception also costs precious time.\"</i><br><br>Sunday, March 26th<br>The couple came to the cafe for the third time, and the man named \"Bill\" brought the girl some papers — documents to invest her family's wealth in. The poor girl, who has never seen the dark side of the human heart, does not know how to refuse, and is played like a fiddle by the cunning loaf.<br><br><i>\"The investment document incessantly tugs at her shame, a constant reminder that the love she longs so dearly for can never overcome a certain line. Faced with such a sudden advancement, she is struck to the bone with nervousness. All she could muster were a few shy nods, unable to refuse anything. Even though she grew up in a generous environment, she never expected the tolerance and goodwill of society.\"</i><br><br>The novel's outline is complete, and I estimate that I should be able to finish it in a month or two.<br><br>Monday, April 3rd<br>Some Silvermane Guards came and said that the Fragmentum's corrosion will soon spread to Backwater Pass, and that I should tell the cafe owner to prepare to move. It's a pity that I've only recently started to like the life at the cafe. I love the feeling of carefully grinding coffee beans and meticulously brewing, only to come up with a bitter lump of paste. Ironic and helpless, just like most people's lives.<br><br>Tuesday, April 4th<br>The couple hasn't been here for almost a week. Maybe it's because the transport hub has been closed to traffic. That \"Love is tragedy\" is something everyone knows. So, let's end the new book with a tragedy.<br><br>Wednesday, April 5th<br>The couple actually came today. They didn't order coffee, just a cup of hot water. The woman cried a lot. It seemed that her father had cut her off after knowing about them, and now she can't even afford to eat. Bill gave her some money to stay at a hotel for a few days before going back to make amends with her father. This Bill is no novice. He's playing the long game.<br><br>Friday, April 7th<br>The surrounding shops are almost all done moving. After cleaning up, I had to go to the Plaza's Management Office to go through the procedures of ending the rent. I didn't expect to see Bill there. The guy was crying to the people at the Management Office about how he was cheated by the young lady of the developer's house. But the people at the Management Office said that the girl named \"Lavonne\" was just a real estate agent. She wasn't the boss's daughter. Ha? Wouldn't you know? Truth really is stranger than fiction.<br><br>Sunday, April 9th<br>There is still a box of candy, and four boxes of outdoor furniture that have not been removed. Despite all his tiredness, my uncle can still be so stingy. Why didn't he ask for help? He just had to come by himself. Oops, I realized I haven't bound my manuscripts yet.
